# disko.nix — Disk partitioning for nixos-anywhere deployment
#
# Defines the SD card partition layout for the Pi 4 Audio Workstation.
# Used by nixos-anywhere for fresh installs on a Pi reachable via SSH.
#
# Layout (MBR):
#   Partition 1: 256 MiB FAT32 (type 0x0C, W95 FAT32 LBA) — VideoCore
#                firmware, U-Boot, config.txt, DTBs. MBR type 0x0C is what
#                the proven sd-image.nix used. VideoCore scans for FAT
#                partitions by MBR type (0x0B/0x0C).
#   Partition 2: rest of disk ext4 (type 0x83) — NixOS root filesystem
#
# This module is NOT imported by configuration.nix. It's added as an extra
# module by the mugge-deploy NixOS configuration in flake.nix.
#
# Firmware population is handled by firmware.nix's activation script, which
# runs during nixos-anywhere's chroot install (before first boot) and on
# every subsequent nixos-rebuild switch.
#
# F-273: MBR partition table matching repart-image.nix. Both deployment
# paths (SD card image and nixos-anywhere) use MBR with identical filesystem
# labels (FIRMWARE, NIXOS_SD). Partitions are referenced via
# /dev/disk/by-label/ (filesystem labels), ensuring nixos-rebuild switch
# works regardless of whether the SD card was created by the image builder
# or nixos-anywhere. The fileSystems entries below match the shared
# declarations in configuration.nix.
#
# Uses disko's legacy "table" type (not "gpt") because the "gpt" type only
# supports GPT partition tables. The "table" type with format = "msdos"
# produces MBR. The legacy table type uses list-based partition definitions
# with start/end positions (parted syntax).
#
# T-072-18: nixos-anywhere fresh install
# Usage: nixos-anywhere --flake .#mugge-deploy root@<target-host>
#
# T-072-19: Incremental upgrade (after initial install)
# Usage: nix run nixpkgs#nixos-rebuild -- switch --flake .#mugge-deploy --target-host ela@<target-host> --sudo
