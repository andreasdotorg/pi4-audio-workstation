# Project Memory Index — mugge

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| playwright-usage.md | Playwright browser testing rules: screenshot vs DOM snapshot, web UI connection details, hidden element cleanup |
| d040-architecture-transition.md | D-040 architecture knowledge: FilterChainCollector, pcm-bridge metering, GraphManagerClient, D-043 bypass defense, SETUP-MANUAL.md stale references, Python deployment gap (S-002), _MEAS_DIR path resolution, deploy.py stale coeffs path, signal-gen subsonic HPF gap (D-031 safety) |
| security-findings.md | Security defects: F-036 VNC 8-char password limit (DES/RFB), F-037 (HIGH) web UI no authentication on port 8080 |
| coding-principles.md | Core architectural principle: temporal/spatial memory safety — all safety-relevant invariant checks (bounds, channel count, etc.) must be runtime assert, never debug_assert. F-116 precedent. |
| pipewire-rt-promotion.md | PipeWire RT promotion model: JACK clients need LimitRTPRIO/LimitMEMLOCK (not CPUSchedulingPolicy=fifo). PW promotes callback threads; client process stays SCHED_OTHER. F-033/F-020 distinction. |
| orchestrator-discipline.md | Orchestrator Rule 2 violations: must not do technical analysis of failures or prescribe HOW (implementation steps, specific function calls). Relay WHAT, worker figures out HOW. |
