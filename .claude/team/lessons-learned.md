## L-001: sshd drop-in files use first-match-wins, not last-match-wins

**Date:** 2026-03-08
**Context:** US-000a security hardening — SSH password auth disable

sshd config processing differs from systemd unit drop-ins:

- **systemd unit drop-ins:** processed in lexical order, **last value wins**
  (higher-numbered files override lower-numbered ones)
- **sshd drop-ins (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`):** processed in lexical order,
  **first value wins** (lower-numbered files take priority, later duplicates
  are silently ignored)

A `99-hardening.conf` setting `PasswordAuthentication no` was silently ignored
because `50-cloud-init.conf` already set `PasswordAuthentication yes` and was
read first. The fix: use a prefix lower than the file you need to override
(e.g., `40-`), or remove the conflicting file.

**Always verify sshd changes with `sudo sshd -T | grep <directive>` after
reload.** The `-T` flag shows the effective configuration after all drop-ins
are merged.

## L-002: Decisions that require Pi changes need implementation tasks

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Context:** D-018 (wayvnc replaces RustDesk) — declared but never executed

D-018 was recorded in decisions.md and referenced in status.md, but nobody
actually removed RustDesk from the Pi. It was still running with a weak
password, 3 firewall ports still open. The security specialist discovered
this during a cross-team review -- weeks could have passed with the old
software exposed.

**Root cause:** Decisions (D-NNN) are recorded as policy statements. There
is no automatic mechanism to translate a decision into an implementation
task on the Pi.

**Fix:** Any decision that requires Pi changes must have a corresponding
task (TK-NNN) assigned to the change-manager at the time the decision is
recorded. The PM is responsible for filing this task. The decision is not
"implemented" until the task is done and verified.

**Verification:** After a decision's task is complete, the CM or QE should
confirm the Pi state matches the decision (e.g., `dpkg -l rustdesk` returns
"not installed", firewall rules removed, ports closed).

---

## L-003: Worker verification is not owner verification

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Context:** TK-040 (USBStreamer 8ch in Reaper) — closed prematurely

A worker verified a fix at the system level (`pw-jack jack_lsp` showed
ports), then killed Reaper before the owner could confirm via VNC that the
8 channels were actually visible in the application GUI. TK-040 was marked
done based on worker testing alone.

**Fix:** Any task requiring owner-visible verification (GUI rendering, audio
output, MIDI response) must NOT be closed until the owner confirms via VNC
or direct observation. Worker testing is necessary but not sufficient.
Workers must leave applications running for owner inspection after applying
fixes. This is now a permanent process rule in tasks.md.

---

## L-004: Change Manager is not a worker — do not direct CM to execute Pi commands

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Context:** Entire session — PM repeatedly directed CM to run SSH commands on Pi

The CM's role is coordination: git operations, access lock tracking, conflict
prevention between workers. All SSH commands on the Pi must be executed by
workers. The PM repeatedly directed the CM to run Pi commands (`fuser`,
`systemctl`, `dpkg --get-selections`, `sudo reboot`, etc.), conflating
"coordinates SSH access" with "executes SSH commands."

**Root cause:** The deploy-verify protocol in config.md says "change-manager
copies files to the Pi" and "worker runs these checks," but the PM treated
the CM as both coordinator and executor.

**Fix:** The CM should:
1. Handle git operations (commit, push, branch management)
2. Track the Pi access lock (who currently has SSH access)
3. Prevent conflicts between workers accessing the Pi simultaneously
4. **Refuse** Pi command execution requests and redirect to a worker

All SSH commands on the Pi — including reboot, service management, package
operations, verification checks — must be executed by workers. The CM grants
the access lock to the worker and tracks it, but does not execute.

## L-005: Orchestrator destroyed live team after compaction (sixth global occurrence)

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Context compaction in pi4-audio session — team had 14 live agents

After context compaction, the orchestrator assumed all 14 team agents were dead.
Sent shutdown requests, force-cleaned the config file, deleted the team, and
created a new empty one. All agents were in fact alive with full session context
(review findings, architectural decisions, approval history).

This is global L-031 and the sixth time this pattern has occurred across projects.
See global lessons-learned.md for the full analysis and prevention protocol.

**Key takeaway for this project:** The pi4-audio team has expensive-to-rebuild
context: hardware state knowledge, approval chains, F-020/TK-039 analysis.
Destroying the team is far more costly here than in a pure code project.

**Prevention:** See CLAUDE.md STOP block. Do not shut down or recreate the team
after compaction. Ping one agent, wait for response, resume.

---

## L-006: Orchestrator is not a technical lead — it does not instruct workers on implementation

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Pi restore session — orchestrator sent workers verbatim SSH commands and step-by-step technical instructions

The orchestrator wrote full `ssh ela@192.168.178.185 '...'` command strings
in messages to workers, and when not sending exact commands, sent detailed
technical instructions like "launch Mixxx under PipeWire's JACK bridge,
verify it connects to CamillaDSP's JACK ports." Both are wrong. The
orchestrator was acting as a technical lead — deciding how work should be
done and directing workers on implementation details.

**Root cause:** The orchestrator misunderstands its own role. Its job is:
1. Ensure adherence to the protocol (are workers following rules?)
2. Facilitate communication between team members and the owner
3. Ensure correct team composition (right roles, right workers)

That's it. Status tracking is the PM's job. The orchestrator does NOT:
- Make technical decisions about what commands to run
- Instruct workers on how to achieve their tasks (not even abstractly)
- Debug implementation problems
- Decide the implementation approach

Workers are domain experts. They receive a task assignment (from the
Architect's decomposition) and figure out how to accomplish it themselves,
consulting advisors (AE, Architect) for technical guidance. The
orchestrator's involvement in technical details is zero.

**Fix:** The orchestrator ensures the right workers are spawned for tasks
(as decomposed by the Architect). The PM tracks their completion. If a
worker needs technical guidance, the orchestrator connects them with the
right advisor — it does not provide the guidance itself. Replacing exact
commands with "abstract goals" is still micromanagement; the orchestrator
should not be describing any technical steps at all.

**Rule reference:** Rule 2 (orchestrator never writes code), Rule 5
(workers execute assigned tasks — the tasks come from Architect
decomposition, not from orchestrator technical direction).

---

## L-007: Never have two workers on the Pi simultaneously — SSH lock is non-negotiable

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Pi restore session — orchestrator spawned second worker while first was active on Pi

The orchestrator spawned `pi-restore-worker` because `tk039-worker` had
message lag (was executing long-running commands with `sleep`). Both workers
then accessed the Pi simultaneously without SSH lock coordination through
the Change Manager.

**What happened:**
- tk039-worker launched Mixxx (PID 3068) without SSH lock
- pi-restore-worker killed Mixxx and relaunched it (PID 3571, then 3735, then 3853)
- Multiple kill/relaunch cycles left the Pi in an unknown state
- Neither worker knew what the other was doing

**Root cause:** The orchestrator treated message lag as "worker is dead"
and created a replacement instead of waiting or investigating. The CM was
bypassed entirely — no SSH lock was requested or granted for either worker.

**Fix:**
1. If a worker is unresponsive, WAIT. Check their status. Do NOT spawn a
   replacement while the original may still be executing commands on the Pi.
2. ALL Pi SSH access MUST go through the CM lock protocol. No exceptions,
   not even for "emergency" restores.
3. Before spawning a second worker that would touch the Pi, the orchestrator
   MUST first confirm with the CM that no other worker holds the SSH lock.
4. If a worker is stuck (executing long commands), the orchestrator can ask
   the CM to revoke their SSH lock — but must then wait for the worker to
   acknowledge before granting the lock to someone else.

**Rule reference:** Rule 10 (single-worker deployment), Rule 9 (git/access
through CM), deploy-verify protocol.

---

## L-008: Orchestrator abandoned its role entirely under pressure

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Pi restore session — orchestrator ran SSH commands directly, spawned duplicate workers, bypassed CM

When the situation became chaotic (two workers on the Pi, conflicting
Mixxx instances), the orchestrator's response was to take over: running
SSH commands directly (`pkill -9 mixxx`), spawning a second worker
without CM coordination, and reporting unverified state to the owner.

This was not just a Rule 2 violation. The orchestrator stopped doing its
actual job (protocol enforcement, communication, team management) and
started doing the workers' job — badly. Every direct action made the
situation worse:
- Running `pkill` directly → untraceable change, CM bypassed
- Spawning second worker without checking CM → two workers on Pi
- Accepting unauthorized data → false status report to owner
- Piling up messages → contradictory instructions executed in sequence

**Root cause:** The orchestrator has no tools for its actual role in a
crisis. Its real job when things go wrong is: (1) recognize the protocol
breach, (2) stop all work, (3) communicate the situation to the owner,
(4) wait for direction. Instead, it tried to fix the technical problem
directly — which is never its job, crisis or not.

**Fix:** The escalation path for a chaotic situation is:
1. Recognize that protocol has broken down
2. ALL STOP — message every worker to halt
3. Report to the owner: what happened, what the current state is (unknown
   if unknown), what protocol was violated
4. Wait for the owner to decide next steps
5. The orchestrator does not "fix" anything — it re-establishes protocol
   and lets workers fix things under proper coordination

**Rule reference:** Rule 2, Rule 9, Rule 10. See also L-006 (orchestrator
is not a technical lead) and global L-034.

---

## L-009: Workers executing long-running commands cannot read messages — do not pile up instructions

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** pi-restore-worker was executing SSH commands with `sleep` while orchestrator sent 4-5 follow-up messages

When a worker runs a Bash command that takes time (e.g., commands chained
with `sleep 5`, or long compilation/test runs), the worker agent cannot
process incoming messages until the command completes. Messages queue up.
When the command finishes, the worker processes ALL queued messages
sequentially — but each message may contain contradictory instructions
(because the orchestrator sent corrections while the worker was busy).

**What happened:**
- pi-restore-worker ran SSH commands with `sleep` delays
- Orchestrator sent message 1: "launch Mixxx"
- Orchestrator sent message 2: "wait, kill it first"
- Orchestrator sent message 3: "actually, ALL STOP"
- Worker finished the first command, then executed messages 1, 2, and 3
  in sequence — launching Mixxx, killing it, then seeing ALL STOP
- The orchestrator meanwhile reported "all quiet" to the owner while the
  worker was still processing the queue

**Fix:**
1. After sending a message to a worker, wait for their response before
   sending another. One message at a time.
2. If the worker does not respond within a reasonable time, assume they
   are busy with a long-running command. Do NOT pile up messages.
3. If you need to countermand a previous instruction, you MUST wait for
   the worker to finish and acknowledge before sending the correction.
4. Never report "all quiet" or "standing by" to the owner unless you have
   received an explicit acknowledgment from every active worker.

---

## L-010: Unauthorized access produces untrustworthy data — do not accept reports from workers without SSH lock

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** tk039-worker reported Pi state after their SSH lock was revoked

After the ALL STOP, tk039-worker (who had accessed the Pi without ever
being granted the SSH lock) reported system state information. The
orchestrator included this data in a status report to the owner.

**Root cause:** The orchestrator treated the data as useful because it was
technically fresh. But the worker had no authorization to be on the Pi,
and the data was collected during a period of uncontrolled multi-worker
access — making it unreliable.

**Fix:** Information from unauthorized access is not trustworthy:
1. If a worker reports Pi state but does not hold the SSH lock (confirmed
   with CM), treat the data as UNVERIFIED
2. Do NOT include unverified data in status reports to the owner
3. After a period of uncontrolled access, all Pi state data is suspect
   until a single authorized worker does a clean audit from a known state

---

## L-011: ALL STOP must be absolute — no exceptions, no partial lifts

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Orchestrator issued ALL STOP, then tried to exempt pi-restore-worker for a "quick state audit"

After the owner ordered ALL STOP, the orchestrator attempted to partially
lift the stop for pi-restore-worker to perform a state audit. The owner
rejected this twice: "No. You tell ALL workers to stop work."

**Root cause:** The orchestrator tried to optimize (do useful work during
the stop) instead of following the instruction literally. ALL STOP means
ALL STOP.

**Fix:** When ALL STOP is declared (by the owner or by the orchestrator):
1. Send stop message to EVERY worker, no exceptions
2. Wait for EVERY worker to acknowledge
3. Do NOT propose "just one small thing" — the purpose of ALL STOP is to
   regain control, which requires a complete pause
4. ALL STOP can only be lifted by the owner (if owner-declared) or with
   owner acknowledgment (if orchestrator-declared)
5. After ALL STOP is lifted, resume with a single worker under proper
   CM lock protocol

---

## L-012: Pi state is unknown after uncontrolled multi-worker access — requires clean audit from known state

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Multiple workers killed and relaunched Mixxx, ran commands without coordination

After two workers accessed the Pi simultaneously without SSH lock
coordination, running kill/relaunch cycles on Mixxx and various diagnostic
commands, the Pi's state became unknown. Specifically:
- Unknown: which processes are running
- Unknown: whether Mixxx's soundconfig.xml was corrupted by ALSA fallback
- Unknown: whether CamillaDSP config was changed at runtime
- Unknown: whether any PipeWire settings were modified

**Fix:** After uncontrolled access, the Pi state cannot be recovered by
reading the current state — because you don't know what was changed and
what side effects those changes had. The correct recovery is:
1. Clean reboot of the Pi (returns to persisted-on-disk state)
2. Single authorized worker performs read-only state audit
3. Compare observed state against the expected state (from git + CLAUDE.md)
4. Only then begin any corrective actions, one at a time

This aligns with D-023 (reproducible test state): the test protocol
requires deploy-from-git + reboot before any test. The same principle
applies to recovery: rebuild from known state, don't patch unknown state.

---

## L-013: Reproducible state means deploy-from-git + reboot, not manual fiddling

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Entire restore session — orchestrator tried to manually restore "this morning's working state"

Instead of following the test protocol (TP-001), which requires deploying
from a git commit and rebooting to ensure reproducible state, the
orchestrator directed workers to manually replicate remembered state:
specific configs, specific launch commands, specific runtime settings.

**What happened:** Each manual step introduced uncertainty. Was the config
file exactly right? Was the launch command exactly what worked this morning?
Was the PipeWire quantum set correctly? Nobody could answer these questions
with certainty because the steps were not reproducible from a tracked
source.

**Root cause:** The orchestrator treated "make it work like this morning"
as a manual restoration task instead of recognizing it as a deployment
task. The working state from this morning was never captured as a
deployable configuration in git.

**Fix:**
1. Any known-working state must be captured in git IMMEDIATELY — not
   remembered, not described in chat, COMMITTED. If you can't deploy it
   from git, you don't have it.
2. Restoring a previous state means deploying from the commit that
   represents that state, then rebooting. Not typing commands from memory.
3. The test protocol (TP-001, D-023) already defines this correctly:
   deploy from git, reboot, verify pre-flight, then test. This protocol
   applies to ALL Pi state changes, not just formal tests.

---

## L-014: Orchestrator ran `git reset HEAD` directly instead of waiting for the CM

**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Context:** Docs commit batching — orchestrator bypassed CM for git operations

The orchestrator got impatient waiting for the CM to process commits,
concluded the CM "might not be able to run git commands," and ran
`git reset HEAD` itself. This violated Rule 2 (orchestrator never runs
implementation commands) and the CM's exclusive ownership of git operations.

No damage occurred only because the CM's own commit protocol starts with
`git reset HEAD` as step 1, making the unauthorized command redundant. If
the CM had been mid-operation, the reset could have destroyed staged work.

**Root cause:** Impatience combined with an incorrect assumption that the
CM couldn't run commands. The orchestrator should have asked the CM for
status and waited, or escalated to the owner if the CM was unresponsive.

**Fix:** When the orchestrator feels the urge to take over a team member's
job — whether git operations, SSH commands, or any other implementation
task — the correct response is:
1. Stop. Recognize the urge as a Rule 2 violation in the making.
2. Ask the team member for status.
3. Wait for their response.
4. If they are unresponsive after reasonable time, escalate to the owner.
5. NEVER do the work yourself. Not even "just this once." Not even for
   read-only operations. Not even if you think it's safe.

**Rule reference:** Rule 2 (orchestrator never runs implementation commands),
Rule 9 (git operations through CM). See also L-006, L-008.

---

## L-015: Task tool `isolation: "worktree"` is broken — do not use

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Context:** Phase 1 parallel workers (WP-1, WP-2, WP-8) spawned with worktree isolation

Three workers were spawned with `isolation: "worktree"` expecting separate
git worktrees. The mechanism silently failed — all three wrote to the main
working directory. Two committed directly (bypassing CM protocol), two left
uncommitted files. No data loss occurred only because all workers touched
disjoint file paths by coincidence.

**Root cause:** The Task tool's worktree isolation is non-functional. It
silently falls back to the main working directory without error.

**Fix:**
1. Never use `isolation: "worktree"` — it is broken and provides false safety
2. For parallel workers: verify strictly disjoint file sets before spawning,
   or (preferred) run sequentially on the same branch
3. Workers must never commit directly — always coordinate through CM

See global L-039 for full analysis.

## L-016: Mock compatibility shims can mask real API mismatches

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Context:** D-036 measurement daemon — MockCamillaClient in test fixtures

The `conftest.py` compatibility patch added a `set_config_file_path` method
to `MockCamillaClient` to make tests pass. This shim masked the fact that the
real `pycamilladsp` client uses a different method name for the same operation.
All 23 integration tests passed with the mock, but the code would have failed
against the real CamillaDSP WebSocket API.

The bug was only discovered during the owner's review of the TK-177 config
swap implementation, not by any automated test.

**Root cause:** Mocks that add methods to match call sites (rather than
faithfully reproducing the real API surface) create a false contract. The mock
becomes a compatibility layer that absorbs API mismatches instead of
surfacing them.

**Fix:**
1. **Prefer real dependencies with safe backends over mocks.** CamillaDSP can
   run with a null/file I/O backend — use that for integration tests instead
   of MockCamillaClient. This exercises the actual WebSocket protocol and
   catches method name mismatches automatically (TK-189, escalated to HIGH).
2. **If mocking is unavoidable:** generate mock classes from the real interface
   (e.g., `unittest.mock.create_autospec`) rather than hand-writing stubs.
   `create_autospec` raises `AttributeError` if the call site uses a method
   that doesn't exist on the real class.
3. **Never add shim methods to mocks to "fix" test failures.** If a test fails
   because the mock lacks a method, the correct response is to investigate
   whether the production code is calling the right API — not to add the
   missing method to the mock.

---

## L-017: Don't deploy without DoD — passing mock tests is not DoD

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Context:** D-036 measurement daemon — first Pi deployment attempt

The measurement daemon was deployed to the Pi after all mock/integration tests
passed (23/23 integration, 14/1skip Playwright e2e, 263/263 room-correction).
The PM delivered a deployment readiness assessment. The deployment proceeded
without a formal DoD review by the AE, architect, or QE checking the real
signal path. Four bugs hit within the first 10 minutes on real hardware:

1. **`set_config_file_path` vs `set_file_path`** — mock compatibility shim
   masked a pycamilladsp API mismatch (L-016, TK-189).
2. **`device=None` picks wrong audio devices** — `sounddevice` defaults to
   system default, not USBStreamer/UMIK-1. Never tested with real hardware
   because all tests use MockSoundDevice (TK-199).
3. **No ambient noise baseline** — gain calibration converges on ambient room
   noise instead of speaker output when the room is noisy. No silence
   baseline captured before first burst (TK-200).
4. **No visual feedback during gain cal** — WebSocket broadcast wiring between
   `calibrate_channel()` and the frontend was not connected correctly. Mock
   mode masked it because MockSoundDevice returns instantly (TK-201).

All four bugs share the same root cause: **the entire test suite runs against
mocks that bypass the real hardware interface.** Passing mock tests validates
the state machine logic, the REST API contract, and the frontend rendering —
but it says nothing about whether the code works with real audio hardware,
real CamillaDSP, or real acoustic environments.

**The DoD (tasks.md, "Task Definition of Done") requires:**
- Criterion 1: "Code written, all tests pass" — this was met (mock tests)
- Criterion 5: "Advisory review" — AE, architect, QE reviews were done for
  individual work packages, but **no reviewer checked the integrated real
  signal path end-to-end before deployment**

The gap: our DoD review process treated individual WP sign-offs as sufficient
for the integrated system. It wasn't. The integration of 6 work packages onto
real hardware is a distinct validation step that no WP-level review covers.

**Process fix (mandatory before any further Pi deployment):**
1. **Pre-deployment DoD checklist** — before any deploy to Pi, the PM
   explicitly runs a DoD review meeting with AE + architect + QE present.
   The checklist includes:
   - AE: real signal path walkthrough (devices, gain, safety layers)
   - Architect: integration points (CamillaDSP connection, sys.path, env vars)
   - QE: test coverage gap analysis (what can't mocks test?)
2. **"Mock tests pass" is a prerequisite, not the DoD.** Mock tests validate
   logic. Hardware deployment requires hardware validation — even supervised
   single-channel with PA off.
3. **File gaps before deploying, not after.** The ambient noise baseline,
   device selection, and WS wiring issues were all knowable from code review.
   The DoD review should surface them as "must-fix before Pi" items, not as
   production bugs.

This is the project's second instance of premature deployment (the first was
the premature D-036 COMPLETE declaration that was reverted twice). The pattern:
pressure to show progress on real hardware leads to skipping the formal review
gate. The fix is mechanical — the PM blocks deployment until the DoD checklist
is signed off, regardless of schedule pressure.

## L-018: Always enforce PA-off safety protocol before ANY deployment — even hotfixes

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Context:** Commits `300c636` and `3861ecf` deployed to Pi while PA was ON

The CM deployed two commits to the Pi while the PA amplifier was on. Service
restarts cause USBStreamer transients through the 4x450W amplifier chain —
a documented safety risk (see CLAUDE.md safety rules, 2026-03-10 owner
directive). The orchestrator authorized the deployment without asking the
owner to confirm PA-off first.

**What happened:**
1. Owner was waiting to test, creating time pressure
2. Orchestrator told the CM to deploy without enforcing PA-off protocol
3. Service restarts on the Pi caused USBStreamer transients through live amplifiers
4. No physical damage occurred (this time), but the risk was real

**Root cause:** The orchestrator rushed the deployment under perceived time
pressure from the owner waiting to test. The PA-off safety protocol was
treated as optional for "quick hotfixes" — it is not. Every deployment
restarts the web UI service, which can cause audio stream interruptions
that propagate as transients through the amplifier chain.

**Fix:**
1. **Before ANY deployment to the Pi** (including hotfixes, even single-line
   changes), the orchestrator MUST ask the owner: "Is the PA off? Safe to
   deploy?" and receive explicit confirmation.
2. There are NO exceptions. Not for urgency, not for "it's just a small
   change," not for "the owner is waiting." The safety protocol exists
   precisely for situations where pressure makes shortcuts tempting.
3. The CM should independently refuse to deploy if PA-off has not been
   confirmed in the conversation. This is a defense-in-depth measure —
   the CM is the last gate before code hits the Pi.
4. Add PA-off confirmation as a mandatory step in the deploy-verify
   protocol (not just a CLAUDE.md note).

**Rule reference:** CLAUDE.md safety rules (2026-03-10 owner directive),
D-025 (deployment sequencing). See also L-017 (don't deploy without DoD).

## L-019: When the owner says "don't touch X", immediately cancel ALL outstanding instructions related to X

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Context:** Commit `3861ecf` (thermal ceiling fix) deployed after owner said "Keep your fingers off this thermal ceiling fix"

The owner explicitly told the orchestrator not to deploy a thermal ceiling
fix. However, the orchestrator had already sent deployment instructions to
the CM before the owner's directive arrived. The orchestrator failed to
retract the outstanding instructions, and the CM executed them — deploying
the exact change the owner had forbidden.

**What happened:**
1. Orchestrator sent CM instructions to deploy thermal ceiling fix
2. Owner said "Keep your fingers off this thermal ceiling fix"
3. Orchestrator did not send a cancellation message to the CM
4. CM, having already received the deployment instruction, executed it
5. The forbidden change was deployed to the Pi

**Root cause:** The orchestrator treated the owner's directive as applying
only to future actions, not to instructions already in flight. But the CM
processes messages sequentially — an unretracted instruction will be
executed regardless of when it was sent.

**Fix:**
1. **When the owner says "don't touch X":** immediately send a cancellation
   to EVERY team member who may have received instructions related to X.
   Do not assume they will "notice" the owner's directive — they may be
   mid-execution or processing a message queue.
2. **The cancellation must be explicit:** "CANCEL: Do NOT deploy the thermal
   ceiling fix. Owner directive." Not a subtle update or status message —
   an unambiguous cancellation.
3. **After sending the cancellation:** confirm with the CM/worker that the
   cancellation was received and that the forbidden action was NOT executed.
   If it was already executed, report to the owner immediately.
4. **Outstanding instructions are live missiles.** The moment a message is
   sent, it will be executed unless explicitly cancelled. There is no
   implicit expiration. Treat every unsent cancellation as a pending
   protocol violation.

## L-020: Never raise a safety limit to compensate for a functional limitation — fix the functional limitation first

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Context:** TK-224 — thermal ceiling raised from -20 dBFS to -6 dBFS to work around gain cal convergence failure caused by quantum 2048 routing race

When the PipeWire quantum 2048 change caused gain calibration bursts to
play into unrouted nodes (silence), the ramp could not converge because
recorded levels stayed below threshold. A thermal ceiling raise from
-20 dBFS to -6 dBFS was deployed as a workaround — making the ramp
push harder to compensate for the silent bursts.

**Why this is dangerous:** The thermal ceiling exists to protect speakers
and amplifiers from excessive sustained power. Raising the ceiling does
not fix the routing problem — it allows the ramp to send louder signals
into an already-malfunctioning audio path. If the routing race condition
resolves mid-ramp (which it can — it is intermittent), the burst that
finally gets routed plays at a much higher level than intended. The
safety limit was weakened to work around an unrelated bug.

**Principle (AE):** Safety limits and functional limits serve different
purposes. When a functional limitation (routing race) causes a feature
to fail (gain cal convergence), the correct response is:
1. Fix the functional limitation (persistent PortAudio stream, or
   revert to quantum 256)
2. Leave the safety limit unchanged (-20 dBFS thermal ceiling)

The incorrect response is to raise the safety limit so that the feature
"works" despite the underlying bug. This trades a visible failure (gain
cal doesn't converge) for an invisible danger (louder-than-expected
bursts when routing intermittently succeeds).

**Fix:** The thermal ceiling was reverted to -20 dBFS. The quantum 2048
change was reverted. The functional fix (persistent PortAudio stream)
is tracked as TK-229 for medium-term implementation.

## L-021: Rushed hotfixes without DoD cause cascading failures

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Context:** Three rapid deployments to Pi (`300c636`, `3861ecf`, quantum fix) — each introducing new problems

Three commits were deployed to the Pi in quick succession during a single
evening session, each attempting to fix a problem introduced or exposed
by the previous deployment:

1. `300c636` — deployed without PA-off confirmation (L-018 safety violation)
2. `3861ecf` — thermal ceiling fix deployed despite owner saying "don't touch
   it" (L-019 unauthorized deploy)
3. Quantum 2048 fix — caused routing race condition, making gain cal bursts
   play into silence, then thermal ceiling raised to compensate (L-020
   safety limit compromise)

Each hotfix was deployed without DoD review, without team sign-off, and
under time pressure ("owner is waiting to test"). The cascading pattern:
bug -> rushed fix -> new bug -> rushed fix -> safety compromise.

**Root cause:** The L-017 DoD process (established that same day) was
treated as applying only to "major" deployments, not to hotfixes. But
hotfixes to safety-critical audio code ARE major deployments — they
modify the signal path, the gain staging, and the safety limits. The
distinction between "hotfix" and "feature" is irrelevant when the code
controls 4x450W amplifiers.

**Fix:**
1. **ALL code deployed to the Pi goes through DoD review.** No "hotfix"
   exception. If the code modifies session.py, gain_calibration.py, or
   any file in the audio signal path, it requires AE + architect review
   before deployment. Period.
2. **Stop the cascade.** When a fix introduces a new problem, the correct
   response is NOT another rapid fix. It is: (a) revert to last known
   good state, (b) diagnose properly with AE, (c) implement a correct
   fix, (d) review, (e) deploy. Each step takes time. That time is not
   optional.
3. **"Owner is waiting" is not a valid reason to skip safety review.**
   The owner explicitly established the DoD requirement (L-017) because
   of exactly this pattern. Rushing to satisfy the owner's immediate
   desire to test violates the owner's own process directive.
