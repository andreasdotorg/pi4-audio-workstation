# configure-libjack-alternatives.sh — Configure Debian alternatives to prefer
# PipeWire's libjack over JACK2's libjack.
#
# Background (F-021): Without this, bare `mixxx` loads JACK2's libjack, tries
# to connect to a non-existent JACK2 server, and falls back to ALSA (corrupting
# soundconfig.xml). With PipeWire's libjack as the preferred alternative,
# bare `mixxx` uses PipeWire automatically — no pw-jack wrapper needed.
#
# Run on the Pi as root (or with sudo). Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   configure-libjack-alternatives.sh              # register + verify
#   configure-libjack-alternatives.sh --discover   # show installed paths only
#
