# Pi 4B Portable Audio Workstation — Project Context

## CRITICAL: Orchestrator Rules After Context Compaction

**READ THIS FIRST. EVERY TIME. ESPECIALLY AFTER COMPACTION.**

1. **The team is STILL ALIVE after compaction.** Do NOT shut them down. Do NOT
   recreate the team. Ping each core member to verify they are alive. Only
   respawn dead agents.
2. **You are the ORCHESTRATOR. You NEVER write code, edit files, or run
   implementation commands.** ALL work is done by workers via the Task tool or
   by messaging existing team members. The ONLY exception is editing this file
   and team configuration files (Rule 11 meta-process).
3. **Re-read the orchestration protocol** at `.claude/team/protocol/orchestration.md`
   before doing ANYTHING after compaction.
4. **Re-read this file, config.md, status.md, decisions.md, user-stories.md**
   before doing anything.
5. **Maximize context by minimizing your own work.** Delegate everything. Your
   job is to coordinate, not to do. Every command you run, every file you read,
   every tool call you make costs context. Message team members instead.
6. **The change-manager coordinates BOTH git operations AND SSH access to the Pi.**
   Workers message change-manager to run Pi commands. Do not run Pi commands yourself.
7. **Team name:** `pi4-audio`. 10 core members (see Team section below).
8. See `~/mobile/gabriela-bogk/team-protocol/lessons-learned.md` — L-001, L-007,
   L-008, L-021, L-023 are ALL about the orchestrator doing work directly after
   compaction. This has happened FIVE TIMES before. Do not be the sixth.

## Project Summary

Building a portable flight-case audio workstation based on a Raspberry Pi 4B, replacing
a Windows PC. Two operational modes: DJ/PA (psytrance events) and live vocal performance
(Cole Porter repertoire with backing tracks). The system handles crossover, room
correction, multi-channel routing, and time alignment — all on the Pi 4.

## Owner

Gabriela Bogk. This is a personal project, not mobile.de work.

## Current Mission

**Next session: TK-055 — apply upstream V3D RT fix and test hardware GL on PREEMPT_RT.**

Upstream patch found (`raspberrypi/linux#7035`, Melissa Wen / Igalia) that fixes the
exact V3D ABBA deadlock we diagnosed in F-012. Confirmed working on Pi 4B + Pi 5 by
2 independent reporters. If it works on our system: D-021 software rendering requirement
eliminated, hardware GL restored, Mixxx CPU drops from 142-166% to ~85%, DJ-A becomes
trivially viable. Evaluate TK-055 BEFORE TK-054 (software rendering fallback).

**Pi is currently on stock PREEMPT kernel with hardware GL** (switched for listening
session 2026-03-09 evening). labwc service `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` line was removed.
Before resuming RT work: either apply the patch and test with hardware GL, or restore
the pixman line and switch back to RT kernel.

See `docs/project/status.md` for full current state. Decisions in `docs/project/decisions.md`.

### Core Team (10 members)
- **Coordination:** Product Owner, Project Manager, Change Manager
- **Advisory:** Architect (+ RT performance), Audio Engineer, Security Specialist, UX Specialist, Technical Writer
- **Quality:** Quality Engineer
- **Challenge:** Advocatus Diaboli

### Hardware Access Protocol
All SSH to Pi goes through the Change Manager to prevent conflicts.
Pi: `ela@192.168.178.185` (hostname: mugge), key-based auth, passwordless sudo.

## Pi Hardware State (verified 2026-03-09)

- **OS:** Debian 13 Trixie. **Currently booted: stock PREEMPT kernel (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8`)**. Switched from RT for listening session 2026-03-09 evening. `config.txt` has `kernel=kernel8.img`.
- **Desktop:** labwc (Wayland) with **hardware V3D GL** (safe on stock PREEMPT). `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` line removed from `~/.config/systemd/user/labwc.service`. lightdm disabled, labwc runs as systemd user service. **NOTE:** before switching back to RT kernel, either apply TK-055 V3D patch or re-add `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` to labwc service.
- **V3D:** On PREEMPT_RT, V3D causes ABBA deadlock (F-012). **Upstream fix available:** `raspberrypi/linux#7035`. On stock PREEMPT, V3D is safe. Current state: V3D loaded and active (stock kernel).
- **Audio:** PipeWire 1.4.2, CamillaDSP 3.0.1 at SCHED_FIFO 80 (systemd override). PipeWire RT module FAILS to self-promote to FIFO on PREEMPT_RT (F-020) — needs manual `sudo chrt -f -p 88 $(pgrep -x pipewire)` after each start.
- **Quantum:** Production config at `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-audio-settings.conf` sets quantum 256. DJ mode needs quantum 1024 (set at runtime via `pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-quantum 1024`).
- **99-no-rt.conf:** DELETED (was Test 3 artifact forcing PipeWire to SCHED_OTHER).
- **Mixxx:** Requires `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 pw-jack mixxx`. Software rendering = 92-166% CPU. Waveforms disabled, framerate 5 FPS. Still glitches at quantum 256 — testing quantum 1024 (DJ mode).
- **USB devices:** UMIK-1, USBStreamer, Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra, APCmini mk2, Nektar SE25
- **UMIK-1 calibration:** `/home/ela/7161942.txt` (magnitude-only, serial 7161942, -1.378dB sensitivity)
- **Firewall:** nftables active (US-000a). Port 8080 runtime-only rule for PoC.
- **SSH:** Password auth likely enabled (default), key-based working
- **Listening ports:** SSH (22), rpcbind (111), CUPS (631/localhost only)
- **Installed:** CamillaDSP 3.0.1, Mixxx 2.5.0, Reaper 7.31, wayvnc 0.9.1. RustDesk removed (D-018).

## Owner Preferences (from session 2026-03-08)

- **Remote desktop:** wayvnc (D-018 superseded RustDesk; RustDesk removed)
- **Reproducibility:** NixOS with flake long-term. Trixie + lab notes for now.
- **DJ mode:** Hercules-primary, APCmini optional enhancement
- **Mode switching:** Whole-gig for starters, quick switch future nice-to-have
- **Singer IEM:** Engineer controls for MVP, singer self-control future bonus
- **Singer needs:** Extra track for vocal cues (Reaper provides)
- **IEM signal path:** Reaper → CamillaDSP (passthrough on ch 7/8, no FIR processing) → USBStreamer. Per D-011: CamillaDSP holds exclusive ALSA access to all 8 channels, so IEM cannot bypass it.

## Key Documents

  deliverable. See "Next Steps" below.

## Software Stack

- **PipeWire** — Audio server, provides JACK bridge for apps
- **CamillaDSP v3.0.1** — DSP engine (crossover + room correction via FIR convolution)
- **Mixxx** — DJ software (DJ/PA mode)
- **Reaper** — DAW for live mixing (Live mode, installed via Pi-Apps or manual download)
- **REW** — Room measurement (may run on Pi or separate machine)

## Critical Design Decisions

### 1. Combined Minimum-Phase FIR Filters (not IIR crossover)

We do NOT use traditional IIR (Linkwitz-Riley) crossovers. Instead, the crossover slope
and room correction are combined into a single minimum-phase FIR filter per output
channel. This was a deliberate choice for psytrance transient fidelity:

- **LR4 IIR crossover**: ~4-5ms group delay at 80Hz crossover, smears kick transients
- **Linear-phase FIR**: zero group delay but ~6ms pre-ringing at 80Hz — audible ghosts
- **Minimum-phase FIR (chosen)**: ~1-2ms group delay, NO pre-ringing, crisp transients

The combined filters are generated by the automated room correction pipeline (not yet
built). CamillaDSP loads them as WAV files. This means you can't tweak crossover
frequency in CamillaDSP YAML — you regenerate the FIR coefficients instead.

Filter files:
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_left_hp.wav` — Left main (highpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_right_hp.wav` — Right main (highpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_sub1_lp.wav` — Sub 1 (lowpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_sub2_lp.wav` — Sub 2 (lowpass + correction)

### 2. Dual Chunksize: 2048 (DJ) vs 512 (Live)

- DJ/PA mode: `chunksize: 2048` (42.7ms latency) — efficient convolution, saves CPU for Mixxx
- Live mode: `chunksize: 512` (10.7ms latency) — prevents singer hearing slapback echo from PA

The singer's IEM path bypasses CamillaDSP (~5ms latency). But she also hears the PA
acoustically. If PA path > ~25ms, she perceives slapback of her own voice. At chunksize
512, total PA path is ~18ms — acceptable.

**D-011 supersedes D-002 for live mode:** Live mode now targets chunksize 256 + PipeWire
quantum 256 (~21ms bone-to-electronic latency). Fallback: chunksize 512 + quantum 256
(~31ms). DJ mode unchanged at chunksize 2048 + quantum 1024.

### 3. Two Independent Subwoofers

Sub 1 and Sub 2 have independent:
- FIR correction filters (different placement = different room interaction)
- Delay values (different distance to listening position)
- Gain trims

Both receive the same L+R mono sum as source material.

### 4. FIR Filter Length: 16,384 taps

At 48kHz, 16,384 taps = 341ms = 2.9Hz frequency resolution.
- 10.2 cycles at 30Hz — solid correction
- 6.8 cycles at 20Hz — adequate correction with headroom
- Fallback: 8,192 taps if CPU too tight (3.4 cycles at 20Hz, viable for live venues)

## Assumptions Needing Validation

Full assumption register (A1-A26): `docs/project/assumption-register.md`

Original assumptions tracked in the Test Plan (SETUP-MANUAL.md section 6.13):

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Test |
|----|-----------|------------|------|
| A1 | 16k taps @ chunksize 2048 fits in Pi 4 CPU budget alongside Mixxx | HIGH | T1a, T3a |
| A2 | 16k taps @ chunksize 512 fits in Pi 4 CPU budget alongside Reaper | MEDIUM | T1b, T3b |
| A3 | End-to-end PA latency in live mode < 25ms | VALIDATED (D-011) | T2b: 30.3ms at chunksize 512 (FAIL vs 25ms), ~20ms projected at chunksize 256 (D-011) |
| A4 | Pi 4 thermals stay below 75°C in flight case under sustained load | LOW | T4 |
| A5 | 16k-tap FIR actually provides effective correction at 20Hz | MEDIUM | T5 |
| A6 | Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra presents as USB-MIDI on Linux | UNKNOWN | Manual test |
| A7 | Mixxx runs adequately on Pi 4 with OpenGL ES via Xvfb/V3D | MEDIUM | Manual test |
| A8 | APCmini mk2 Mixxx mapping exists or can be created | UNKNOWN | Research |

## Test Plan Summary (run these FIRST)

The tests are defined in detail in SETUP-MANUAL.md section 6.13. Run them in this order:

1. **T1a-e**: CamillaDSP CPU consumption at various chunksize/filter-length combos
   (synthetic dirac filters, no real audio needed). This gates everything else.
2. **T2a-b**: End-to-end latency measurement (loopback cable on ADA8200)
3. **T3a-b**: 30-minute stability tests (xruns, CPU, temperature)
4. **T4**: Thermal test in actual flight case
5. **T5**: Verify 16k-tap FIR correction effectiveness at 20Hz (needs real room measurements)

**Decision tree:**
- T1b PASS (16k @ chunksize 512 < 45% CPU) → proceed with 16k taps for both modes
- T1b FAIL, T1d PASS (8k @ chunksize 512 < 30%) → use 8k taps for live mode, 16k for DJ
- T1b FAIL, T1d FAIL → increase live chunksize to 1024 (21ms) and retest

## Next Steps — Automated Room Correction Pipeline

This is the next major deliverable. It should be a **separate document** with
accompanying scripts. The pipeline automates:

### Measurement Phase
1. Place UMIK-1 at measurement position (center of dancefloor)
2. Apply UMIK-1 calibration file (frequency-dependent sensitivity correction)
3. For each output channel individually:
   - Play a log sweep (20Hz-20kHz) through that channel only
   - Record the response via UMIK-1
   - Compute impulse response via deconvolution
4. Take multiple measurements at slightly different positions (for spatial averaging
   in the correction region — reduces sensitivity to exact mic placement)

### Time Alignment Phase
5. From each per-channel impulse response, detect the arrival time (onset of energy)
6. Compute relative delays between all speakers
7. The furthest speaker = reference (delay 0); all others get positive delay to compensate

### Correction Filter Generation Phase
8. For each output channel, compute the correction filter:
   a. **Target curve**: Harman-like curve, SPL-dependent (more bass boost at lower SPL,
      flatter at high SPL typical of PA). Allow user to select target.
   b. **Frequency-dependent windowing**: Correct room modes (narrow peaks/nulls) below
      ~300Hz aggressively. Above 300Hz, only smooth out broad speaker response
      deviations — do NOT try to correct individual reflections/comb filtering at
      high frequencies (they shift with any movement and the "correction" makes things
      worse).
   c. **Psychoacoustic smoothing**: Apply fractional-octave smoothing to the measured
      response before computing the inverse. 1/6 octave below 200Hz, 1/3 octave
      200-1kHz, 1/2 octave above 1kHz. This prevents the filter from chasing
      narrow-band artifacts that aren't perceptually relevant.
   d. **Regularization**: Cut-only correction with -0.5dB safety margin (D-009).
      All correction filters must have gain ≤ -0.5dB at every frequency. Room
      peaks are attenuated; nulls are left uncorrected. Target curves are applied
      as relative attenuation (cut mid/treble relative to bass), not as boost.
      Every generated filter is programmatically verified before deployment.
      Psytrance source material at -0.5 LUFS leaves zero headroom for boost.
   e. **Phase handling**: The entire chain must be consistently minimum-phase.
      - UMIK-1 calibration: minimum-phase (it's a magnitude-only correction file)
      - Measured impulse response: extract minimum-phase component
      - Computed inverse: minimum-phase
      - Crossover shape: designed as minimum-phase FIR
      - All convolved together → single minimum-phase combined filter

### Crossover Integration Phase
9. Generate the crossover shape as a minimum-phase FIR:
   - Highpass (for mains): steep rolloff below crossover freq (default 80Hz)
   - Lowpass (for subs): steep rolloff above crossover freq
   - Slope: 48-96 dB/oct (steeper than any practical IIR, enabled by FIR)
10. Convolve (multiply in frequency domain) the crossover with the room correction
11. Convert the result to minimum-phase (Hilbert transform of log magnitude)
12. Truncate/window to target length (16,384 taps)
13. Export as WAV files to `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/`

### Automation Goal
The end goal: arrive at venue, set up speakers, place mic, press one button (or run
one script), and the system measures, computes, and deploys correction filters
automatically. The script should:
- Guide the user through mic placement
- Run all measurements automatically
- Generate and deploy filters
- Update CamillaDSP delay values
- Restart CamillaDSP with new filters
- Run a mandatory verification measurement to confirm correction effectiveness (per design principle #7)

### Tools
- Python with scipy, numpy, soundfile for DSP
- Possibly REW for measurement (if it works on Pi ARM — needs verification)
- Or: implement measurement entirely in Python (generate sweep, record, deconvolve)
- CamillaDSP Python API (`pycamilladsp`) for live configuration updates

### Key Challenges
- **Multiple measurement positions**: Take 3-5 measurements in a cluster around the
  listening position, average the responses. This reduces the correction's sensitivity
  to exact mic position and makes it effective over a wider area.
- **Comb filtering at high frequencies**: Reflections cause frequency-dependent
  constructive/destructive interference patterns that shift with any positional change.
  Correcting these at a single point makes them worse everywhere else. The solution:
  only correct the direct sound + early reflections envelope, not individual combs.
  Frequency-dependent windowing of the impulse response before inversion handles this.
- **Consistent minimum phase**: Every step in the chain must preserve or produce
  minimum-phase results. If the mic calibration is applied as a magnitude-only
  correction, the measured IR is windowed to extract its minimum-phase component, and
  the inverse + crossover are computed in the minimum-phase domain, the final result
  will be correct. Any accidental linear-phase or mixed-phase step corrupts the chain.
- **Subwoofer placement interaction**: Subs near walls/corners have strong room coupling
  that varies dramatically with position. Each sub needs its own measurement and
  correction. The two sub filters may end up looking very different.
- **Temperature-dependent speed of sound**: At 30°C (hot venue), sound travels at 349 m/s
  vs 343 m/s at 20°C. This is a ~1.7% change, affecting time alignment by ~0.05ms per
  meter. Negligible for our purposes, but worth noting.

## Open Questions / TODOs

- [ ] Verify Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra USB-MIDI on Linux (plug it in and check)
- [ ] Check if APCmini mk2 has a Mixxx mapping (forums, GitHub)
- [ ] Verify REW runs on Pi 4 ARM (Java-based, should work but needs testing)
- [x] ~~Decide if measurement pipeline should use REW or pure Python~~ D-016: both. REW for exploratory work, Python for automation pipeline.
- [ ] Determine if `gpu_mem=128` is needed for Mixxx or if Xvfb works with `gpu_mem=16`
- [x] ~~Check if Raspberry Pi OS Trixie ships a PREEMPT_RT kernel package~~ YES. D-013 + D-021: PREEMPT_RT mandatory with V3D eliminated.
- [ ] Test whether PipeWire or native JACK gives better latency/stability on Pi 4
- [ ] Investigate CamillaDSP's websocket API for runtime filter hot-swapping
- [ ] Flight case design: ventilation, cable routing, power distribution
- [ ] Write the automated room correction pipeline document + scripts
- [ ] **F-020:** Investigate PipeWire RT module self-promotion failure on PREEMPT_RT. Persist workaround (systemd override or ExecStartPost chrt).
- [ ] **Mixxx perf:** Investigate further CPU reduction — 92% with waveforms off is too much for quantum 256. Options: lighter skin, QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen for controller-only use, stock PREEMPT for DJ mode.
- [ ] **Quantum 1024 DJ mode test:** Currently in progress. Does 21ms buffer absorb llvmpipe scheduling jitter?
- [ ] **T3d:** 30-min stability test on PREEMPT_RT with Option B. Prerequisite: F-020 workaround persisted, quantum 1024 for DJ mode.
- [ ] **Watchdog reliability:** BCM2835 watchdog failed on Test 3 and Test 5 (2/11 lockups). Investigate.
- [ ] **Upstream V3D bug report:** Reproduction steps clean (Test 1). Include Test 5 (client-only V3D also deadlocks).

## Design Principles

1. **Test early**: Run the performance tests (T1-T4) before investing in the room
   correction pipeline. If the Pi 4 can't handle the load, we need to know before
   writing complex DSP code.
2. **Two modes, one system**: DJ/PA and Live share the same hardware and audio stack.
   Only the CamillaDSP config and the application (Mixxx vs Reaper) change.
3. **Transient fidelity for psytrance**: The combined minimum-phase FIR approach was
   chosen specifically for crisp kick transients. This is a non-negotiable requirement.
4. **20Hz correction headroom**: 16,384-tap filters give 6.8 cycles at 20Hz. This
   ensures solid sub-bass correction even in rooms with strong modes below 30Hz.
5. **Singer comfort**: Live mode latency must stay below ~20ms on the PA path to avoid
   slapback perception for the vocalist.
6. **Automation**: The room correction pipeline should be one-button for each venue.
   The gig setup workflow: power on → audio stack auto-starts → place mic → run
   calibration script → remove mic → ready to perform.
7. **Fresh measurements per venue**: All room correction filters and time alignment
   values are regenerated at each venue setup. The measurement pipeline is an
   operational tool, not a one-time calibration. Platform self-diagnostics run
   before each measurement session to detect drift from system updates.

## Session History

This project was developed in conversation. Key discussion points:

1. **Initial feasibility assessment**: Pi 4B evaluated for the full audio stack.
   CamillaDSP upstream benchmark (8ch × 262k taps @ 192kHz = 55% CPU) suggests
   more headroom than initially feared.

2. **IIR vs FIR crossover debate**: Started with LR4 IIR crossover in the configs.
   User raised concern about psytrance transient quality. Analysis showed LR4 has
   4-5ms group delay at 80Hz crossover — significant for kick-heavy music. Switched
   to combined minimum-phase FIR approach: crossover + room correction in one filter,
   ~1-2ms group delay, no pre-ringing.

3. **Latency debate for live mode**: Initial config used chunksize 2048 everywhere
   (42.7ms). User caught that this creates slapback for the singer. Analysis of the
   signal path: singer's IEM is direct (~5ms), but PA path goes through CamillaDSP.
   Singer hears both → slapback at >25ms. Solution: live mode uses chunksize 512
   (10.7ms CamillaDSP, ~18ms total PA path). This doubles CamillaDSP CPU cost but
   is offset by Reaper being lighter than Mixxx.

4. **FIR filter length and frequency resolution**: User correctly identified that
   shorter filters limit the lowest correctable frequency. Analysis: at 48kHz, need
   ~5 cycles at the target frequency for proper correction. For 20Hz: need 12,000
   samples minimum → 16,384 taps (6.8 cycles at 20Hz). For 30Hz: 8,192 taps would
   suffice (5.1 cycles). Decision: 16,384 for both modes, 8,192 as fallback.

5. **Two independent subs**: Each sub gets its own FIR correction filter and delay
   value because different physical placement = different room interaction.
   Both receive the same L+R mono sum as source material.
