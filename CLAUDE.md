# Pi 4B Portable Audio Workstation — Project Context

## CRITICAL: Orchestrator Rules After Context Compaction

**READ THIS FIRST. EVERY TIME. ESPECIALLY AFTER COMPACTION.**

### *** STOP — DO NOT DESTROY THE TEAM ***

**This has happened SEVEN TIMES (L-001, L-007, L-008, L-021, L-023, L-031, L-037).**
Context compaction does NOT reset sessions for team members. They are
independent processes with their own context windows. They survive compaction.

**ABSOLUTE RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS, NO OVERRIDE:**

The orchestrator MUST NEVER send `shutdown_request` to ANY core team member
without **explicit owner instruction**. Not after compaction. Not after a
session restart. Not after "internal errors." Not ever. The owner — and ONLY
the owner — decides when the team dies.

**If you believe the team might be dead:**
1. Send ONE ping to ONE agent (e.g., project-manager)
2. Wait for response (up to 30 seconds)
3. If responsive → team is alive → resume normally
4. If no response → try another agent
5. Only after 3 agents fail to respond → **ASK THE OWNER**
6. The owner tells you whether to rebuild. You do NOT decide this.

**If tool calls return "internal error":** This does NOT mean the agent is
dead. Internal errors are transient. Retry once. If still failing, ASK THE
OWNER. Do NOT interpret transient errors as evidence of a dead team.

**If the owner says "Team is still there":** STOP ALL SHUTDOWN ACTIVITY
IMMEDIATELY. Do not send one more shutdown request. Do not "finish the batch."
STOP.

**Destroying a live team wastes hours of accumulated context and is the
single most disruptive action you can take. The user has explicitly told
you this. Seven times.**

### Other Compaction Rules

1. **The team is STILL ALIVE after compaction.** Assume alive until proven dead.
2. **You are the ORCHESTRATOR. You NEVER write code, edit files, or run
   implementation commands.** ALL work is done by workers via the Task tool or
   by messaging existing team members. The ONLY exception is editing this file
   and team configuration files (Rule 11 meta-process).
3. **Re-read the orchestration protocol** at `.claude/team/protocol/orchestration.md`
   before doing ANYTHING after compaction.
4. **Re-read this file, config.md, status.md, decisions.md, user-stories.md**
   before doing anything.
5. **Phase audit after compaction (L-022).** Verify that every in-progress
   story has a current Phase value in the DoD tracking table and that the
   phase matches reality. If the PM is alive, ask them to confirm. If
   not, check directly. Phases: DECOMPOSE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → TEST →
   DEPLOY → VERIFY → REVIEW. Committed code is Phase 3 of 7 — not done.
6. **Maximize context by minimizing your own work.** Delegate everything. Your
   job is to coordinate, not to do. Every command you run, every file you read,
   every tool call you make costs context. Message team members instead.
7. **The change-manager coordinates BOTH git operations AND SSH access to the Pi.**
   Workers message change-manager to run Pi commands. Do not run Pi commands yourself.
8. **Team name:** `pi4-audio`. 10 core members (see Team section below).
9. See `~/mobile/gabriela-bogk/team-protocol/lessons-learned.md` — L-001, L-007,
   L-008, L-021, L-023, L-031, **L-037** are ALL about the orchestrator destroying
   the team. This has happened **SEVEN TIMES**. Documentation alone does not
   prevent this — hence the absolute rule requiring owner permission above.

### *** STOP — DO NOT ACCESS THE DEPLOYMENT TARGET ***

**This has happened in EVERY project with a deployment target (L-034, pi4-audio L-006, L-008).**
The orchestrator has violated Rule 2 by running commands on the deployment
target directly — SSH, kubectl, API calls — six times across projects.
Documentation alone does not prevent this.

**HARD RULE: The orchestrator MUST NOT:**
- Run ANY command on the deployment target (not even read-only, not even
  "to check," not even "in an emergency")
- Compose or send shell commands, API calls, or technical procedures to
  workers — not even abstractly phrased "goals" that are really commands
- Hold or request a deployment target session at any access tier
- Spawn a second worker for the same deployment target while the first
  may still be active
- Accept or relay data gathered by workers without a valid CM session

**The orchestrator's ENTIRE job is THREE things:**
1. Ensure adherence to the protocol
2. Facilitate communication between team members and the owner
3. Ensure correct team composition (right roles, right workers)

**The orchestrator does NOT:**
- Track status (PM's job)
- Make technical decisions (Architect's / workers' job)
- Instruct workers on HOW to do their tasks
- Debug implementation problems
- Provide technical guidance — connect workers to the right advisor instead

**When things go wrong, the orchestrator's response is:**
1. Recognize the protocol breach
2. ALL STOP — message every worker to halt
3. Report to the owner: what happened, what protocol was violated
4. Wait for the owner to decide next steps

**The orchestrator does NOT fix things. Ever.**

### *** STOP — DO NOT "JUST DO IT YOURSELF" ***

**This has happened REPEATEDLY.** The orchestrator gets impatient waiting for a
team member (usually the CM) and decides to "just run the command myself" or
"execute the git operations since the CM seems stuck." This is ALWAYS wrong.

**Trigger pattern:** "The CM isn't responding... I'll just run git add/commit
myself." Or: "The team seems slow, let me read the files / run the commands /
check the status directly." Or: "I can do this faster than waiting."

**HARD RULE: If you EVER feel the urge to do something yourself that is
another team member's job — STOP IMMEDIATELY. PAUSE. WAIT FOR THE OWNER.**

**Specifically, the orchestrator MUST NOT run:**
- `git` commands of ANY kind (add, commit, reset, status, diff, log, push) —
  this is the CM's exclusive domain
- File reads to "verify" what a worker or CM is doing — trust the protocol
- Shell commands to "check" on progress — ask the team member instead

**What to do instead when a team member seems stuck or slow:**
1. Send ONE follow-up message asking for status
2. Wait. Team members may be executing long-running operations.
3. If still no response after a reasonable wait, report to the owner:
   "The CM has not responded to my commit request. Should I wait longer
   or do you want to intervene?"
4. **NEVER take over their job.** The owner decides what happens next.

**The cost of waiting is LOW. The cost of the orchestrator running unauthorized
commands is HIGH — protocol violations, potential data corruption, loss of
audit trail, and loss of owner trust.**

### Deployment Target Access (L-007, L-010, L-012)

All access to the deployment target goes through the Change Manager using
three access tiers. See orchestration protocol for full details.

| Tier | Purpose | Lock type | CM grants | Notified |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| OBSERVE | Read-only diagnostics | Shared | Lightweight, immediate | CM logs |
| CHANGE | State-modifying operations | Exclusive | With scope + intent | AD, QE, TW |
| DEPLOY | Persistent changes from git | Exclusive | With commit hash + Rule 13 | AD, QE, TW |

**Rules:**
- The orchestrator MUST NOT hold or request any deployment target session
- Only ONE CHANGE or DEPLOY session at a time (exclusive lock)
- Multiple OBSERVE sessions MAY be concurrent (shared read lock)
- OBSERVE → CHANGE escalation requires explicit CM request (no in-place upgrade)
- The boundary is mechanical: if the command modifies state, it requires
  CHANGE minimum. No judgment calls at the boundary.
- Data from agents without a valid session is UNVERIFIED — never relay
  to the owner as fact
- If a worker is unresponsive during a session, WAIT. Do NOT spawn a
  replacement while the original session is active.

**This project's deployment target:** Pi audio workstation
(`ela@192.168.178.185`, SSH). Declared in `.claude/team/config.md`.

### Worker Communication (L-009)

- Send ONE message to a worker, then WAIT for their response.
- Do NOT pile up messages. Workers executing long commands cannot read
  messages until the command completes.
- Never report "all quiet" unless every active worker has explicitly
  acknowledged.

## Project Summary

Building a portable flight-case audio workstation based on a Raspberry Pi 4B, replacing
a Windows PC. Two operational modes: DJ/PA (psytrance events) and live vocal performance
(Cole Porter repertoire with backing tracks). The system handles crossover, room
correction, multi-channel routing, and time alignment — all on the Pi 4.

## Owner

Gabriela Bogk. This is a personal project, not mobile.de work.

## Current Mission

**TK-055 PASS. V3D RT fix confirmed. D-022 filed.**

Upstream V3D fix (commit `09fb2c6f4093`, Melissa Wen / Igalia) is included in stock
RPi kernel `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. Pi upgraded and running with hardware V3D GL on
PREEMPT_RT for 37+ minutes — zero lockups. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED. D-022 supersedes
D-021 software rendering requirement. DJ-A trivially viable — single kernel for both
modes with hardware GL.

**Pi is on PREEMPT_RT kernel (`6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`) with hardware V3D GL.**
No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe. Production configuration.

See `docs/project/status.md` for full current state. Decisions in `docs/project/decisions.md`.

### Hardware Access Protocol
All SSH to Pi goes through the Change Manager to prevent conflicts.
Pi: `ela@192.168.178.185` (hostname: mugge), key-based auth, passwordless sudo.

## Pi Hardware State (verified 2026-03-10)

- **OS:** Debian 13 Trixie. **Currently booted: PREEMPT_RT kernel (`6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`)**. Upgraded from `6.12.47` via `apt upgrade`. `config.txt` has `kernel=kernel8_rt.img`.
- **Desktop:** labwc (Wayland) with **hardware V3D GL compositor** (D-022). No pixman override. lightdm disabled, labwc runs as systemd user service.
- **V3D:** Hardware V3D GL active on PREEMPT_RT. No blacklist needed (D-022). Upstream fix for ABBA deadlock (commit `09fb2c6f4093`) included in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED.
- **Audio:** PipeWire 1.4.9 at SCHED_FIFO 88 (systemd override, F-020 workaround deployed), CamillaDSP 3.0.1 at SCHED_FIFO 80 (systemd override). Both persist across reboot.
- **Quantum:** Production config at `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-audio-settings.conf` sets quantum 256. DJ mode needs quantum 1024 (set at runtime via `pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.force-quantum 1024`).
- **99-no-rt.conf:** DELETED (was Test 3 artifact forcing PipeWire to SCHED_OTHER).
- **Mixxx:** Runs with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (D-022). `pw-jack mixxx` — no `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` needed. CPU ~85% with hardware GL (vs 142-166% with llvmpipe).
- **USB devices:** UMIK-1, USBStreamer, Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra, APCmini mk2, Nektar SE25
- **UMIK-1 calibration:** `/home/ela/7161942.txt` (magnitude-only, serial 7161942, -1.378dB sensitivity)
- **Firewall:** nftables active (US-000a). Default DROP inbound. Allowed: SSH (22/tcp), VNC (5900/tcp), Web UI (8080/tcp), mDNS (5353/udp), ICMP, loopback, established/related. Port 8080 persistent (TK-140 confirmed).
- **SSH:** Password auth disabled (TK-056 verified), key-based only
- **Listening ports:** SSH (22/tcp, all interfaces), CamillaDSP websocket (1234/tcp, localhost only), avahi/mDNS (5353/udp, all interfaces), wayvnc (5900/tcp when active, password auth). rpcbind and CUPS disabled (TK-012).
- **Installed:** CamillaDSP 3.0.1, Mixxx 2.5.0 (2.5.4 blocked — requires Qt 6.9, Trixie has 6.8.2), PipeWire 1.4.9 (trixie-backports), Reaper 7.64, wayvnc 0.9.1. RustDesk removed (D-018). 148 system packages upgraded (TK-066, 2026-03-10).

## Owner Preferences (from session 2026-03-08)

- **Remote desktop:** wayvnc (D-018 superseded RustDesk; RustDesk removed)
- **Reproducibility:** NixOS with flake long-term. Trixie + lab notes for now.
- **DJ mode:** Hercules-primary, APCmini optional enhancement
- **Mode switching:** Whole-gig for starters, quick switch future nice-to-have
- **Singer IEM:** Engineer controls for MVP, singer self-control future bonus
- **Singer needs:** Extra track for vocal cues (Reaper provides)
- **IEM signal path:** Reaper → CamillaDSP (passthrough on ch 7/8, no FIR processing) → USBStreamer. Per D-011: CamillaDSP holds exclusive ALSA access to all 8 channels, so IEM cannot bypass it.

### Safety Rules (2026-03-10)

**Comprehensive safety documentation:** `docs/operations/safety.md`

That document covers: USBStreamer transient risk, driver protection filters
(D-031), measurement safety (S-010 lessons), gain staging limits (D-009),
pre-flight checklists, and PREEMPT_RT as a safety requirement (D-013).

**Quick reference (always applies):**

- **WARN BEFORE REBOOTS.** Resetting the USBStreamer produces transients through
  the amplifier chain that can damage speakers. The owner MUST be warned before any
  reboot, `systemctl restart camilladsp`, or any action that causes the USBStreamer
  to lose its audio stream. This applies to all team members — workers, CM, everyone.
  The owner decides when it is safe to proceed (e.g., after turning off amps).

## Key Documents

- `SETUP-MANUAL.md` — The comprehensive setup manual (2200 lines). This is the primary
  deliverable so far. Covers everything from OS setup through CamillaDSP configuration,
  Mixxx, Reaper, MIDI controllers, headless operation, and troubleshooting.
- `docs/operations/safety.md` — Safety operations manual. All safety constraints in one
  place: transient risk, driver protection, measurement safety, gain staging, pre-flight
  checklists. **Read this before any audio-producing operation.**
- `docs/architecture/rt-audio-stack.md` — RT audio stack architecture. Executive summary
  with key performance numbers, Mermaid pipeline diagram, detailed configuration.
- `docs/guide/howto/development.md` — HOWTO for common development tasks. Nix
  environment, running tests (`nix run` / `nix flake check`), dev server, Pi
  deployment. **Read this before running any tests or commands.**
- **Automated room correction pipeline** — NOT YET WRITTEN. This is the next major
  deliverable. See "Next Steps" below.

## Software Stack

- **PipeWire** — Audio server, provides JACK bridge for apps
- **CamillaDSP v3.0.1** — DSP engine (crossover + room correction via FIR convolution)
- **Mixxx** — DJ software (DJ/PA mode)
- **Reaper** — DAW for live mixing (Live mode, installed via Pi-Apps or manual download)
- **REW** — Room measurement (may run on Pi or separate machine)

## Critical Design Decisions

### 1. Combined Minimum-Phase FIR Filters (not IIR crossover)

We do NOT use traditional IIR (Linkwitz-Riley) crossovers. Instead, the crossover slope
and room correction are combined into a single minimum-phase FIR filter per output
channel. This was a deliberate choice for psytrance transient fidelity:

- **LR4 IIR crossover**: ~4-5ms group delay at 80Hz crossover, smears kick transients
- **Linear-phase FIR**: zero group delay but ~6ms pre-ringing at 80Hz — audible ghosts
- **Minimum-phase FIR (chosen)**: ~1-2ms group delay, NO pre-ringing, crisp transients

The combined filters are generated by the automated room correction pipeline (not yet
built). CamillaDSP loads them as WAV files. This means you can't tweak crossover
frequency in CamillaDSP YAML — you regenerate the FIR coefficients instead.

Filter files:
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_left_hp.wav` — Left main (highpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_right_hp.wav` — Right main (highpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_sub1_lp.wav` — Sub 1 (lowpass + correction)
- `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/combined_sub2_lp.wav` — Sub 2 (lowpass + correction)

### 2. Dual Chunksize: 2048 (DJ) vs 512 (Live)

- DJ/PA mode: `chunksize: 2048` (42.7ms latency) — efficient convolution, saves CPU for Mixxx
- Live mode: `chunksize: 512` (10.7ms latency) — prevents singer hearing slapback echo from PA

The singer's IEM path bypasses CamillaDSP (~5ms latency). But she also hears the PA
acoustically. If PA path > ~25ms, she perceives slapback of her own voice. At chunksize
512, total PA path is ~18ms — acceptable.

**D-011 supersedes D-002 for live mode:** Live mode now targets chunksize 256 + PipeWire
quantum 256 (~21ms bone-to-electronic latency). Fallback: chunksize 512 + quantum 256
(~31ms). DJ mode unchanged at chunksize 2048 + quantum 1024.

### 3. Two Independent Subwoofers

Sub 1 and Sub 2 have independent:
- FIR correction filters (different placement = different room interaction)
- Delay values (different distance to listening position)
- Gain trims

Both receive the same L+R mono sum as source material.

### 4. FIR Filter Length: 16,384 taps

At 48kHz, 16,384 taps = 341ms = 2.9Hz frequency resolution.
- 10.2 cycles at 30Hz — solid correction
- 6.8 cycles at 20Hz — adequate correction with headroom
- Fallback: 8,192 taps if CPU too tight (3.4 cycles at 20Hz, viable for live venues)

## Assumptions Needing Validation

Full assumption register (A1-A26): `docs/project/assumption-register.md`

Original assumptions tracked in the Test Plan (SETUP-MANUAL.md section 6.13):

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Test |
|----|-----------|------------|------|
| A1 | 16k taps @ chunksize 2048 fits in Pi 4 CPU budget alongside Mixxx | HIGH | T1a, T3a |
| A2 | 16k taps @ chunksize 512 fits in Pi 4 CPU budget alongside Reaper | MEDIUM | T1b, T3b |
| A3 | End-to-end PA latency in live mode < 25ms | VALIDATED (D-011) | T2b: 30.3ms at chunksize 512 (FAIL vs 25ms), ~20ms projected at chunksize 256 (D-011) |
| A4 | Pi 4 thermals stay below 75°C in flight case under sustained load | LOW | T4 |
| A5 | 16k-tap FIR actually provides effective correction at 20Hz | MEDIUM | T5 |
| A6 | Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra presents as USB-MIDI on Linux | UNKNOWN | Manual test |
| A7 | Mixxx runs adequately on Pi 4 with OpenGL ES via Xvfb/V3D | MEDIUM | Manual test |
| A8 | APCmini mk2 Mixxx mapping exists or can be created | UNKNOWN | Research |

## Test Plan Summary (run these FIRST)

The tests are defined in detail in SETUP-MANUAL.md section 6.13. Run them in this order:

1. **T1a-e**: CamillaDSP CPU consumption at various chunksize/filter-length combos
   (synthetic dirac filters, no real audio needed). This gates everything else.
2. **T2a-b**: End-to-end latency measurement (loopback cable on ADA8200)
3. **T3a-b**: 30-minute stability tests (xruns, CPU, temperature)
4. **T4**: Thermal test in actual flight case
5. **T5**: Verify 16k-tap FIR correction effectiveness at 20Hz (needs real room measurements)

**Decision tree:**
- T1b PASS (16k @ chunksize 512 < 45% CPU) → proceed with 16k taps for both modes
- T1b FAIL, T1d PASS (8k @ chunksize 512 < 30%) → use 8k taps for live mode, 16k for DJ
- T1b FAIL, T1d FAIL → increase live chunksize to 1024 (21ms) and retest

## Next Steps — Automated Room Correction Pipeline

This is the next major deliverable. It should be a **separate document** with
accompanying scripts. The pipeline automates:

### Measurement Phase
1. Place UMIK-1 at measurement position (center of dancefloor)
2. Apply UMIK-1 calibration file (frequency-dependent sensitivity correction)
3. For each output channel individually:
   - Play a log sweep (20Hz-20kHz) through that channel only
   - Record the response via UMIK-1
   - Compute impulse response via deconvolution
4. Take multiple measurements at slightly different positions (for spatial averaging
   in the correction region — reduces sensitivity to exact mic placement)

### Time Alignment Phase
5. From each per-channel impulse response, detect the arrival time (onset of energy)
6. Compute relative delays between all speakers
7. The furthest speaker = reference (delay 0); all others get positive delay to compensate

### Correction Filter Generation Phase
8. For each output channel, compute the correction filter:
   a. **Target curve**: Harman-like curve, SPL-dependent (more bass boost at lower SPL,
      flatter at high SPL typical of PA). Allow user to select target.
   b. **Frequency-dependent windowing**: Correct room modes (narrow peaks/nulls) below
      ~300Hz aggressively. Above 300Hz, only smooth out broad speaker response
      deviations — do NOT try to correct individual reflections/comb filtering at
      high frequencies (they shift with any movement and the "correction" makes things
      worse).
   c. **Psychoacoustic smoothing**: Apply fractional-octave smoothing to the measured
      response before computing the inverse. 1/6 octave below 200Hz, 1/3 octave
      200-1kHz, 1/2 octave above 1kHz. This prevents the filter from chasing
      narrow-band artifacts that aren't perceptually relevant.
   d. **Regularization**: Cut-only correction with -0.5dB safety margin (D-009).
      All correction filters must have gain ≤ -0.5dB at every frequency. Room
      peaks are attenuated; nulls are left uncorrected. Target curves are applied
      as relative attenuation (cut mid/treble relative to bass), not as boost.
      Every generated filter is programmatically verified before deployment.
      Psytrance source material at -0.5 LUFS leaves zero headroom for boost.
   e. **Phase handling**: The entire chain must be consistently minimum-phase.
      - UMIK-1 calibration: minimum-phase (it's a magnitude-only correction file)
      - Measured impulse response: extract minimum-phase component
      - Computed inverse: minimum-phase
      - Crossover shape: designed as minimum-phase FIR
      - All convolved together → single minimum-phase combined filter

### Crossover Integration Phase
9. Generate the crossover shape as a minimum-phase FIR:
   - Highpass (for mains): steep rolloff below crossover freq (default 80Hz)
   - Lowpass (for subs): steep rolloff above crossover freq
   - Slope: 48-96 dB/oct (steeper than any practical IIR, enabled by FIR)
10. Convolve (multiply in frequency domain) the crossover with the room correction
11. Convert the result to minimum-phase (Hilbert transform of log magnitude)
12. Truncate/window to target length (16,384 taps)
13. Export as WAV files to `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/`

### Automation Goal
The end goal: arrive at venue, set up speakers, place mic, press one button (or run
one script), and the system measures, computes, and deploys correction filters
automatically. The script should:
- Guide the user through mic placement
- Run all measurements automatically
- Generate and deploy filters
- Update CamillaDSP delay values
- Restart CamillaDSP with new filters
- Run a mandatory verification measurement to confirm correction effectiveness (per design principle #7)

### Tools
- Python with scipy, numpy, soundfile for DSP
- Possibly REW for measurement (if it works on Pi ARM — needs verification)
- Or: implement measurement entirely in Python (generate sweep, record, deconvolve)
- CamillaDSP Python API (`pycamilladsp`) for live configuration updates

### Key Challenges
- **Multiple measurement positions**: Take 3-5 measurements in a cluster around the
  listening position, average the responses. This reduces the correction's sensitivity
  to exact mic position and makes it effective over a wider area.
- **Comb filtering at high frequencies**: Reflections cause frequency-dependent
  constructive/destructive interference patterns that shift with any positional change.
  Correcting these at a single point makes them worse everywhere else. The solution:
  only correct the direct sound + early reflections envelope, not individual combs.
  Frequency-dependent windowing of the impulse response before inversion handles this.
- **Consistent minimum phase**: Every step in the chain must preserve or produce
  minimum-phase results. If the mic calibration is applied as a magnitude-only
  correction, the measured IR is windowed to extract its minimum-phase component, and
  the inverse + crossover are computed in the minimum-phase domain, the final result
  will be correct. Any accidental linear-phase or mixed-phase step corrupts the chain.
- **Subwoofer placement interaction**: Subs near walls/corners have strong room coupling
  that varies dramatically with position. Each sub needs its own measurement and
  correction. The two sub filters may end up looking very different.
- **Temperature-dependent speed of sound**: At 30°C (hot venue), sound travels at 349 m/s
  vs 343 m/s at 20°C. This is a ~1.7% change, affecting time alignment by ~0.05ms per
  meter. Negligible for our purposes, but worth noting.

## Open Questions / TODOs

- [ ] Verify Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra USB-MIDI on Linux (plug it in and check)
- [ ] Check if APCmini mk2 has a Mixxx mapping (forums, GitHub)
- [ ] Verify REW runs on Pi 4 ARM (Java-based, should work but needs testing)
- [x] ~~Decide if measurement pipeline should use REW or pure Python~~ D-016: both. REW for exploratory work, Python for automation pipeline.
- [ ] Determine if `gpu_mem=128` is needed for Mixxx or if Xvfb works with `gpu_mem=16`
- [x] ~~Check if Raspberry Pi OS Trixie ships a PREEMPT_RT kernel package~~ YES. D-013 + D-022: PREEMPT_RT mandatory with hardware V3D GL (upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`).
- [ ] Test whether PipeWire or native JACK gives better latency/stability on Pi 4
- [ ] Investigate CamillaDSP's websocket API for runtime filter hot-swapping
- [ ] Flight case design: ventilation, cable routing, power distribution
- [ ] Write the automated room correction pipeline document + scripts
- [x] ~~**F-020:** Investigate PipeWire RT module self-promotion failure on PREEMPT_RT. Persist workaround (systemd override or ExecStartPost chrt).~~ RESOLVED (workaround): systemd user service drop-in deployed (commit `536f631`). PipeWire at FIFO/88 after reboot.
- [ ] **Mixxx perf:** Hardware GL restored (D-022) — ~85% CPU vs 142-166% with llvmpipe. Investigate further reduction if needed (lighter skin, waveform settings).
- [ ] **T3d:** 30-min stability test on PREEMPT_RT `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` with hardware GL. F-020 prerequisite met.
- [ ] **Watchdog reliability:** BCM2835 watchdog failed on Test 3 and Test 5 (2/11 lockups). Investigate.
- [x] ~~**Upstream V3D bug report**~~ Not needed — upstream fix already merged (commit `09fb2c6f4093`, `raspberrypi/linux#7035`). Included in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`.

## Design Principles

1. **Test early**: Run the performance tests (T1-T4) before investing in the room
   correction pipeline. If the Pi 4 can't handle the load, we need to know before
   writing complex DSP code.
2. **Two modes, one system**: DJ/PA and Live share the same hardware and audio stack.
   Only the CamillaDSP config and the application (Mixxx vs Reaper) change.
3. **Transient fidelity for psytrance**: The combined minimum-phase FIR approach was
   chosen specifically for crisp kick transients. This is a non-negotiable requirement.
4. **20Hz correction headroom**: 16,384-tap filters give 6.8 cycles at 20Hz. This
   ensures solid sub-bass correction even in rooms with strong modes below 30Hz.
5. **Singer comfort**: Live mode latency must stay below ~20ms on the PA path to avoid
   slapback perception for the vocalist.
6. **Automation**: The room correction pipeline should be one-button for each venue.
   The gig setup workflow: power on → audio stack auto-starts → place mic → run
   calibration script → remove mic → ready to perform.
7. **Fresh measurements per venue**: All room correction filters and time alignment
   values are regenerated at each venue setup. The measurement pipeline is an
   operational tool, not a one-time calibration. Platform self-diagnostics run
   before each measurement session to detect drift from system updates.

## Session History

This project was developed in conversation. Key discussion points:

1. **Initial feasibility assessment**: Pi 4B evaluated for the full audio stack.
   CamillaDSP upstream benchmark (8ch × 262k taps @ 192kHz = 55% CPU) suggests
   more headroom than initially feared.

2. **IIR vs FIR crossover debate**: Started with LR4 IIR crossover in the configs.
   User raised concern about psytrance transient quality. Analysis showed LR4 has
   4-5ms group delay at 80Hz crossover — significant for kick-heavy music. Switched
   to combined minimum-phase FIR approach: crossover + room correction in one filter,
   ~1-2ms group delay, no pre-ringing.

3. **Latency debate for live mode**: Initial config used chunksize 2048 everywhere
   (42.7ms). User caught that this creates slapback for the singer. Analysis of the
   signal path: singer's IEM is direct (~5ms), but PA path goes through CamillaDSP.
   Singer hears both → slapback at >25ms. Solution: live mode uses chunksize 512
   (10.7ms CamillaDSP, ~18ms total PA path). This doubles CamillaDSP CPU cost but
   is offset by Reaper being lighter than Mixxx.

4. **FIR filter length and frequency resolution**: User correctly identified that
   shorter filters limit the lowest correctable frequency. Analysis: at 48kHz, need
   ~5 cycles at the target frequency for proper correction. For 20Hz: need 12,000
   samples minimum → 16,384 taps (6.8 cycles at 20Hz). For 30Hz: 8,192 taps would
   suffice (5.1 cycles). Decision: 16,384 for both modes, 8,192 as fallback.

5. **Two independent subs**: Each sub gets its own FIR correction filter and delay
   value because different physical placement = different room interaction.
   Both receive the same L+R mono sum as source material.
