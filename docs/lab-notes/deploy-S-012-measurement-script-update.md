# DEPLOY Session S-012: Measurement Script Update + pycamilladsp

**Evidence basis: CONTEMPORANEOUS**

TW received command-level CC from CM in real time during session execution.

---

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Operator:** worker-measurement (via CM DEPLOY session S-012)
**Host:** mugge (Raspberry Pi 4B, Debian 13 Trixie, kernel 6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt)
**Commit:** `a39e7b7` (from `0075142`)
**Safety precondition:** Non-audio operation (git pull + pip install). No
speaker/amp risk. No PA safety precondition required.
**Scope:** Deploy commit `a39e7b7` to Pi, ensure pycamilladsp available in venv.

---

## Outcome: PASS

All 3 steps passed. Pi updated to `a39e7b7` via fast-forward. pycamilladsp
3.0.0 confirmed available in venv.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Git Pull

```bash
$ cd /home/ela/pi4-audio-workstation && git pull
From https://github.com/andreasdotorg/pi4-audio-workstation
   0075142..a39e7b7  main -> origin/main

 4 files changed, 689 insertions(+), 53 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 scripts/room-correction/tests/test_measurement_config.py
```

Fast-forward from `0075142` to `a39e7b7`. 4 files changed:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docs/project/status.md` | +3 lines |
| `docs/project/tasks.md` | +4/-1 lines |
| `scripts/room-correction/measure_nearfield.py` | +572 lines net (TK-143 CamillaDSP hot-swap integration) |
| `scripts/room-correction/tests/test_measurement_config.py` | New file, 163 lines |

### Step 2: Install pycamilladsp

```bash
$ ~/audio-workstation-venv/bin/pip3 install camilladsp
Requirement already satisfied: camilladsp in ./audio-workstation-venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (3.0.0)
Requirement already satisfied: PyYAML>=6.0 (6.0.3)
Requirement already satisfied: websocket_client>=1.6 (1.9.0)
```

pycamilladsp was already installed in the venv (3.0.0). Dependencies satisfied:
PyYAML 6.0.3, websocket_client 1.9.0.

### Step 3: Verify Import

```bash
$ ~/audio-workstation-venv/bin/python3 -c "import camilladsp; print('import OK'); from camilladsp import CamillaClient; print('CamillaClient OK')"
import OK
CamillaClient OK
```

```bash
$ ~/audio-workstation-venv/bin/pip3 show camilladsp
Name: camilladsp
Version: 3.0.0
```

`CamillaClient` imports successfully. Version confirmed as 3.0.0 via `pip3 show`
(the package does not expose a `__version__` attribute).

## Validation Summary

| Check | Expected | Actual | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Git pull | Fast-forward to `a39e7b7` | Fast-forward `0075142..a39e7b7` | PASS |
| pycamilladsp in venv | Installed, importable | 3.0.0, import OK | PASS |
| CamillaClient available | Import succeeds | `CamillaClient OK` | PASS |

## Deviations from Plan

None.

## Notes

- This deploy includes the TK-143 changes to `measure_nearfield.py` (+572 lines
  net), which add CamillaDSP measurement config hot-swap via pycamilladsp. This
  is the code that will be tested in a subsequent CHANGE session.
- pycamilladsp was already present in the venv, likely installed during a prior
  session. The `pip3 install` confirmed it was up-to-date.
- The new test file `test_measurement_config.py` (163 lines) provides unit tests
  for the measurement config builder.
- The ALL STOP from S-010 concerned measurement script execution (audio signal
  routing safety). This deploy only updates files on disk -- no audio was played
  and no measurement was run.

## Post-Session State

- Pi at commit `a39e7b7`
- pycamilladsp 3.0.0 in `~/audio-workstation-venv`
- Audio stack unchanged (no services restarted, no config swapped)
