## Summary

During the first end-to-end Reaper playback test, CamillaDSP exhibited periodic ~1s
full stalls every ~4s. Root cause: PipeWire's `ada8200-in` adapter
(`20-usbstreamer.conf`) opened `hw:USBStreamer,0` for capture, competing with
CamillaDSP's exclusive ALSA playback on the same USB device. This caused isochronous
USB bandwidth contention on the Pi 4's VL805 USB controller.

**Severity:** High (complete audio dropout, repeating)
**Status:** Fix verified (output-only PASS 300s, capture-active PASS 120s on both PREEMPT and PREEMPT_RT). RT kernel shows decisive improvement: peak load halved, zero throttling. Quantum 128 FAIL (catastrophic) — I/O stack timing, not CPU. D-011 (quantum 256) confirmed as hardware floor. F-012 (Reaper lockup on RT) remains the only blocker to full RT adoption.

## Phase 1: Symptom Observation

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Owner (Gabriela Bogk) + Claude team
**Host:** mugge, Debian 13 Trixie, kernel 6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8 (stock PREEMPT), aarch64

### Initial Symptom

Reaper playing a 1000Hz test tone through the production audio path:

    Reaper -> PipeWire JACK bridge -> Loopback (8ch) -> CamillaDSP -> USBStreamer -> speakers

Observed behavior:
- ~1 second full playback stops every ~4 seconds
- Reaper playhead freezes, meters drop to zero during stops
- Playback resumes automatically after each stop

### Ruling Out VNC Rendering

VNC connection was closed to eliminate rendering overhead as a potential cause.
Owner confirmed via direct listening on ch 1-2 (speaker output):
- **Pauses confirmed audible** -- full silence periods matching visual playhead freezes
- **Small clicks/dropouts also heard** between the major pauses

This confirmed the issue is in the **audio chain**, not Reaper's UI rendering or VNC
overhead. The clicks suggest buffer underruns in addition to the larger stall events.

---

## Phase 2: Diagnostic Investigation

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Claude (automated via SSH)

Five rounds of diagnostic checks were run to characterize the failure.

### Check 1: CamillaDSP Logs

```
93 stall/resume cycles in ~10 minutes
5 buffer underruns on PLAYBACK (output) device
```

CamillaDSP was repeatedly stalling and resuming. The 93 stall/resume cycles over 10
minutes is consistent with the owner's observation of ~1s stalls every ~4s (approx
150 cycles expected at that rate -- 93 suggests some stalls were longer or the timing
varied). The 5 buffer underruns on the PLAYBACK device (hw:USBStreamer) indicate the
output side was starved -- CamillaDSP could not write to the USBStreamer in time.

### Check 2: PipeWire State (pw-top)

```
ALL nodes: QUANT=0, RATE=0
Error counts:
  ada8200-in:       ~11,000 errors
  loopback-8ch-sink: ~6,000 errors
```

Every PipeWire node showed QUANT=0 and RATE=0, indicating the graph was not processing
audio normally. The massive error counts on `ada8200-in` (11K) and `loopback-8ch-sink`
(6K) pointed to sustained I/O failures on both adapters.

The `ada8200-in` adapter had nearly double the errors of the loopback sink. This was
the first clue that the USBStreamer-facing adapter was the primary problem.

### Check 3: Scheduling Priority

```
CamillaDSP: SCHED_OTHER, nice -10
PipeWire:   SCHED_FIFO, priority 88
Reaper:     SCHED_RR, priority 75
```

**Priority inversion detected.** CamillaDSP -- the most latency-critical process in the
audio chain (it holds exclusive ALSA access to the USBStreamer output) -- was running
at the lowest real-time priority of the three audio processes. `SCHED_OTHER` with
nice -10 is not real-time at all; it only provides slightly elevated best-effort
scheduling.

PipeWire at FIFO 88 and Reaper at RR 75 could both preempt CamillaDSP's processing
thread, potentially causing the stalls when CamillaDSP could not complete its buffer
processing within the deadline.

### Check 4: Thermal State

```
Temperature: 82.8C
Throttle flag: 0x80008 (active thermal throttling)
```

**Active thermal throttling confirmed.** The Pi was throttling CPU frequency to prevent
overheating. At 82.8C, the Pi 4 reduces clock speed from 1500MHz, directly impacting
DSP processing time.

Context: US-003 T3b peak was 74.5C with aplay-only workload. The addition of Reaper +
PipeWire graph processing + VNC (before it was closed) pushed thermals well past the
75C criterion and into active throttling territory. This is a contributing factor but
not the root cause -- the stall pattern (discrete 1s stops) does not match thermal
throttling behavior (continuous performance degradation).

### Check 5: Loopback and Graph State

```
Loopback: OPEN on both sides (playback and capture)
Graph driver nodes: 4 found, all running
CamillaDSP buffer level: frozen at exactly 860 across 10 consecutive samples
```

The Loopback device being OPEN on both sides ruled out WirePlumber suspension as the
cause. This was an important negative finding -- WirePlumber suspending the loopback
sink had been an initial hypothesis.

The 4 graph driver nodes being present ruled out a missing clock driver.

The frozen buffer level at exactly 860 across 10 samples was a key finding: CamillaDSP
was alive but not processing. The buffer was neither filling nor draining -- the
pipeline was stuck. This is consistent with the output device (USBStreamer) being
unavailable, causing the write side to block.

### False Lead: WirePlumber Suspension

Initial hypothesis: WirePlumber was suspending the `loopback-8ch-sink` node during
idle moments, causing CamillaDSP to lose its input source and stall.

**Ruled out by Check 5.** The Loopback was OPEN on both sides throughout the
diagnostic period. The `node.pause-on-idle = false` setting in `25-loopback-8ch.conf`
was working as intended for the Loopback side.

However, the hardening changes (see Fix below) added additional suspension prevention
as defense-in-depth, since WirePlumber suspension of the PipeWire adapter could still
theoretically cause issues in other scenarios.

---

## Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis

Two complementary analyses converged on the same root cause:

### Audio Engineer Analysis: USB Isochronous Bandwidth Contention

The `ada8200-in` adapter (`20-usbstreamer.conf`) opens `hw:USBStreamer,0` for 8-channel
S32LE capture at 48kHz. Simultaneously, CamillaDSP opens `hw:USBStreamer,0` for
8-channel S32LE playback at 48kHz.

The USBStreamer is a USB 2.0 Audio Class device connected to the Pi 4's VL805 USB
controller. USB Audio uses isochronous transfers with guaranteed bandwidth allocation.
Both capture and playback streams on the same device share the same USB bus bandwidth
and the same device-side controller.

With both streams active:
- PipeWire's `ada8200-in` adapter continuously reads capture data from the USBStreamer
- CamillaDSP continuously writes playback data to the USBStreamer
- Both compete for the device's isochronous bandwidth and the VL805's processing time
- Under load (Reaper + DSP + thermal throttling), the contention causes periodic
  failures where CamillaDSP's writes are delayed past the deadline

The 11K errors on `ada8200-in` vs 6K on `loopback-8ch-sink` supports this: the capture
adapter was failing more frequently, and its failures cascaded into the playback path.

### Architect Analysis: PipeWire Graph Driver Instability

The `ada8200-in` adapter, when failing to read from the USBStreamer, cycles between
suspension and wake states. Each cycle disrupts the PipeWire graph driver timing,
which cascades to all nodes in the graph (explaining the QUANT=0, RATE=0 across all
nodes). The loopback sink, driven by the same graph, inherits the instability and
cannot deliver audio to CamillaDSP's capture side reliably.

### Convergence

Both analyses point to the same fix: **remove the `ada8200-in` adapter's claim on
`hw:USBStreamer,0`**. CamillaDSP needs exclusive, uncontested access to the
USBStreamer's ALSA playback device.

---

## Phase 4: Fix Applied

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Claude (change-manager, via SSH)

Three changes were applied simultaneously to maximize the chance of resolving the
issue in one cycle:

### Change 1: Disable ada8200-in Adapter

```bash
# On Pi: rename to prevent PipeWire from loading
$ mv ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/20-usbstreamer.conf \
     ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/20-usbstreamer.conf.disabled
```

This removes PipeWire's capture adapter for the USBStreamer, eliminating the
competing ALSA access that caused USB bandwidth contention.

**Impact:** ADA8200 mic/line inputs are no longer available to PipeWire applications.
This is acceptable for testing but **not for production** -- live mode requires mic
input on ADA8200 ch 1 for vocals. See "Production Resolution" below.

### Change 2: Harden Loopback Sink Against Suspension

Updated `25-loopback-8ch.conf` on the Pi with additional properties:

```
node.always-process = true
session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0
priority.driver = 2000
```

These settings ensure the loopback sink:
- Never stops processing, even with no connected clients
- Is never suspended by WirePlumber's session management
- Has elevated priority as a graph driver node

(Defense-in-depth -- WirePlumber suspension was ruled out as the primary cause, but
these settings prevent it from becoming a secondary issue.)

### Change 3: CamillaDSP Real-Time Priority

```bash
# Set CamillaDSP main thread to SCHED_FIFO priority 80
$ sudo chrt -f -p 80 <camilladsp-pid>
```

This resolves the priority inversion identified in Check 3. CamillaDSP now runs at
FIFO 80, below PipeWire (FIFO 88) but above Reaper (RR 75). The priority ordering
is now:

| Process | Policy | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| PipeWire | SCHED_FIFO | 88 |
| CamillaDSP | SCHED_FIFO | 80 |
| Reaper | SCHED_RR | 75 |

This ordering makes sense: PipeWire drives the graph clock and must not be preempted.
CamillaDSP is the output-side bottleneck (holds exclusive USBStreamer access) and must
complete its processing before the deadline. Reaper produces audio but has the
loopback buffer as a shock absorber.

### PipeWire Restart

```bash
$ systemctl --user restart pipewire wireplumber
```

Required to pick up the config changes. Note: this disconnects Reaper's JACK ports --
Reaper needs to be reconnected after restart.

---

## Phase 5: Post-Fix State Assessment

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Claude (single worker, proper SSH protocol)

After the fix and PipeWire restart:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| PipeWire status | active (running) |
| WirePlumber status | active (running) |
| CamillaDSP PID | 4184, running |
| CamillaDSP priority | SCHED_FIFO 80 |
| Temperature | 73.0C (down from 82.8C) |
| Throttle flag | 0x0 (no active throttling) |
| Loopback | OPEN both sides |
| Reaper JACK ports | Disconnected (needs reconnect after PipeWire restart) |

Temperature dropped from 82.8C to 73.0C. The `ada8200-in` adapter was a significant
heat contributor -- its continuous USB I/O and error-recovery cycling consumed CPU and
generated USB controller heat. Removing it brought thermals back within the normal
operating range.

**Verification status:** Fix applied but NOT yet verified with audio playback. Reaper
needs JACK port reconnection, and an automated JACK test script is being built for
repeatable verification.

---

## Phase 6: Protocol Violation

During the diagnostic phase, three workers + the orchestrator SSH'd to the Pi
simultaneously, violating the single-worker SSH access protocol (see CLAUDE.md:
"All SSH to Pi goes through the Change Manager to prevent conflicts").

**What happened:** The urgency of diagnosing the audio stalls led to multiple agents
running SSH commands concurrently. While this did not cause data corruption in this
case (commands were read-only diagnostics), it violated the access lock and could
have caused issues if any commands had been mutating state.

**Resolution:** SSH access lock register was reset. Single-worker access via the
change-manager was restored before the fix was applied.

**Systemic fix needed:** [TBC -- the protocol violation suggests the access lock
mechanism needs hardening or better enforcement.]

---

## Phase 7: Advocatus Diaboli Findings

Five challenges were raised against the fix:

### AD-1: Root Cause Not Isolated

Three fixes were applied simultaneously (disable ada8200-in, harden loopback sink,
CamillaDSP RT priority). This means we cannot definitively attribute the fix to any
single change. The USB bandwidth contention theory is well-supported by the
diagnostic evidence (11K errors on ada8200-in, frozen CamillaDSP buffer, playback
underruns), but scientific rigor would require testing each change independently.

**Mitigation:** The automated test script will enable controlled rollback testing
if needed. For now, all three changes stay as a combined fix.

### AD-2: Test Script Does Not Equal Reaper

The JACK test tone script being built replaces Reaper in the test setup. While this
enables automated, repeatable testing, it does not reproduce Reaper's exact behavior:
- Reaper uses SCHED_RR priority 75 (the test script may not)
- Reaper's JACK client behavior (port naming, buffer management) differs
- Reaper's GUI/DSP thread interaction is absent

The test script is a necessary but not sufficient verification. A Reaper end-to-end
test is still needed for full validation.

### AD-3: ada8200-in Needed for Production (CRITICAL) -- RESOLVED

The `ada8200-in` adapter is required for production live mode -- it provides mic input
on ADA8200 channel 1 for vocals. Disabling it was a temporary diagnostic fix, not a
production solution.

**Production resolution (implemented):** Split ALSA device access via two config changes:

1. **`20-usbstreamer.conf` rewritten as capture-only.** The adapter now opens
   `hw:USBStreamer,0` for capture only (`api.alsa.pcm.source`), with properties that
   prevent it from becoming a graph driver or competing with CamillaDSP:
   - `node.driver = false` (does not drive the PipeWire graph clock)
   - `priority.driver = 0`, `priority.session = 0` (lowest priority)
   - `node.pause-on-idle = false`, `session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0`

2. **`50-usbstreamer-disable-acp.conf` created.** Disables WirePlumber's auto-detected
   ACP profile for the USBStreamer, which would otherwise create duplex nodes that
   conflict with CamillaDSP's exclusive playback access.

CamillaDSP retains exclusive `hw:USBStreamer,0` playback. PipeWire gets capture-only
access. Verified working in Phase 9 tests (0 xruns, 0 anomalies at 120s).

### AD-4: Protocol Violation Needs Systemic Fix

The concurrent SSH access violation was caught and corrected, but the access lock
mechanism relies on team discipline rather than technical enforcement. A technical
enforcement mechanism (e.g., SSH connection limiting, lock file, wrapper script)
would prevent recurrence.

### AD-5: [TBC -- awaiting full AD report]

---

## Phase 8: Test Script Development and Verification

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Claude (script-writer, change-manager via SSH)

### Test Architecture

Three scripts were created to verify the fix without Reaper dependency:

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `scripts/test/jack-tone-generator.py` | JACK callback client: generates 1000Hz sine on ch 1+2, silence on ch 3-8. Registers 8 output ports matching the loopback-8ch-sink layout. Detects JACK xruns and callback gaps (interval > 2x expected). |
| `scripts/test/monitor-camilladsp.py` | CamillaDSP websocket monitor: polls state, processing load, buffer level, clipping, rate adjust at 0.5s intervals. Detects anomalies: buffer drain/crash, load > 85%, state changes, clipping. Outputs JSON summary. |
| `scripts/stability/run-audio-test.sh` | Orchestrator: runs both scripts in parallel, forces PipeWire quantum to 256, collects logs, reports combined PASS/FAIL. |

The test exercises the same code path as Reaper:

    JACK client -> PipeWire JACK bridge -> loopback-8ch-sink -> CamillaDSP -> USBStreamer

### Iteration 1: JACK Client Tried Standalone jackdmp (FAIL)

The JACK client library attempted to start a standalone JACK server (`jackdmp`) rather
than connecting to PipeWire's JACK bridge. This happens when the JACK client is run
via SSH without the user session's runtime directory.

**Fix:** Added environment variables to `run-audio-test.sh`:
```bash
export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/$(id -u)}"
export JACK_NO_START_SERVER=1
export PIPEWIRE_RUNTIME_DIR="${PIPEWIRE_RUNTIME_DIR:-$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}"
```

`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` points the JACK client to PipeWire's socket. `JACK_NO_START_SERVER`
prevents fallback to standalone jackdmp.

### Iteration 2: Wrong libjack.so Loaded (FAIL)

The JACK client loaded the system `libjack.so` (standalone JACK) instead of PipeWire's
JACK compatibility library (`libjack-pw.so`). The system library does not communicate
with PipeWire's JACK bridge.

**Fix:** Changed the tone generator invocation in `run-audio-test.sh` from:
```bash
python3 "$TESTDIR/jack-tone-generator.py"
```
to:
```bash
pw-jack "$PYTHON" "$TESTDIR/jack-tone-generator.py"
```

The `pw-jack` wrapper sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to prefer PipeWire's `libjack-pw.so`,
ensuring the JACK client connects through PipeWire's bridge.

### Iteration 3: Output Ports Not Found (FAIL)

The tone generator searched for JACK ports matching `loopback-8ch-sink` (the PipeWire
`node.name`) but PipeWire's JACK bridge exposes ports using `node.description`
("CamillaDSP 8ch Input") as the JACK client name.

This is the same naming inconsistency encountered during US-028 Phase 2 (initial
`grep loopback` returned empty because JACK client name comes from `node.description`).

**Fix:** Changed `--connect-to` default from `"loopback-8ch-sink"` to
`"CamillaDSP 8ch Input"` in `jack-tone-generator.py`.

### Iteration 4: False Positive Frozen Buffer Anomalies (FAIL -- 56 anomalies)

The test ran to completion with 0 JACK xruns, but the CamillaDSP monitor reported 56
"frozen buffer" anomalies. The frozen-buffer detector flagged whenever the buffer level
changed by less than 1 over 5 consecutive samples.

**Owner verified:** tone was audible on all 4 speaker channels throughout the test. The
"frozen" buffer was actually normal steady-state behavior -- CamillaDSP's buffer level
stabilizes when the pipeline is running smoothly (same ~1018 plateau observed in US-003
T3b).

**Fix:** Revised the monitor's anomaly detection:
- **Removed:** frozen-buffer check (too sensitive, false positive on healthy steady state)
- **Added:** buffer-drain detection (buffer level drops to 0 or decreases monotonically)
- **Added:** buffer-crash detection (buffer level jumps by more than 50% between samples)
- **Retained:** state != RUNNING, load > 85%, clipping detection

### Iteration 5: 60-Second Test (PASS)

```
RESULT: PASS -- 0 xruns, 0 anomalies in 60s
```

The test ran for 60 seconds with:
- 0 JACK xruns
- 0 callback gaps
- 0 CamillaDSP anomalies
- Owner confirmed tone audible on all 4 speaker channels

This verifies that the F-015 fix (disabled ada8200-in + loopback hardening +
CamillaDSP RT priority) eliminates the playback stalls for the JACK->CamillaDSP path.

### Amplitude Adjustment

At the owner's request, the default amplitude was reduced from 0.5 (-6dBFS) to 0.063
(-24dBFS). The original -6dBFS level was uncomfortably loud through the PA at the
speaker output.

### Repo and Deployment Updates

1. **`configs/pipewire/25-loopback-8ch.conf`** updated in repo to match the Pi fix
   (added `node.always-process`, `session.suspend-timeout-seconds`,
   `priority.driver` properties).

2. **`scripts/stability/deploy-to-pi.sh`** updated to deploy the new test scripts
   to `~/bin/` on the Pi alongside existing stability scripts.

### Caveats (Owner-Noted)

The owner raised three important caveats about the test result:

1. **No application load.** The test runs without Reaper (or any DAW). Reaper adds
   SCHED_RR priority 75 scheduling, GUI thread contention, and real audio processing
   workload. The JACK tone generator is a minimal client -- it proves the audio path
   works but does not prove Reaper-specific interactions are resolved.

2. **Stock PREEMPT kernel.** Testing runs on the stock PREEMPT kernel per D-015.
   Production requires PREEMPT_RT per D-013, but F-012 (Reaper hard lockup on RT
   kernel) blocks this. The test result is valid for the stock kernel only.

3. **No input capture.** The test only exercises the output path (JACK -> Loopback ->
   CamillaDSP -> USBStreamer playback). Production live mode requires USBStreamer
   capture (ADA8200 mic inputs). The `ada8200-in` adapter is currently disabled as
   part of the F-015 fix. Re-enabling capture via a capture-only PipeWire profile
   (split ALSA access) is the next task -- required for true end-to-end validation.

---

## Phase 9: Extended Verification and Capture Re-enablement

**Date:** 2026-03-09
**Operator:** Claude (change-manager, capture-verify-worker via SSH)

### 9a: 300-Second Output-Only Test (PASS)

**Kernel:** stock PREEMPT (6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8)
**Config:** ada8200-in disabled, loopback hardened, CamillaDSP SCHED_FIFO 80

Extended the 60s verification from Phase 8 to 300 seconds (5 minutes).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 300s |
| JACK xruns | 0 |
| CamillaDSP anomalies | 0 |
| Buffer level | 1018-1021 (rock steady) |
| Rate adjust | ~0 |
| Processing load | Low (tone generator only, no application load) |

Owner confirmed: "Heard the tone on all four channels. Didn't hear any glitches
or outages."

**Result: PASS.** The F-015 fix is stable over 5 minutes for the output-only path.

### 9b: Capture-Only USBStreamer Adapter (Split ALSA Access)

To resolve AD-3 (ada8200-in needed for production mic input), the architect designed
a split-access configuration:

- **CamillaDSP** retains exclusive playback access to `hw:USBStreamer,0`
- **PipeWire** gets capture-only access to `hw:USBStreamer,0` via a rewritten adapter

Two config files were created/modified:

**`20-usbstreamer.conf` (rewritten):**
The original adapter opened the USBStreamer for full duplex access (capture + playback
contention). The new version is capture-only with properties that prevent graph driver
interference:
```
factory.name     = api.alsa.pcm.source    # capture only (was already source, but now explicitly sole claim)
node.driver      = false                   # do not drive PipeWire graph clock
priority.driver  = 0                       # lowest driver priority
priority.session = 0                       # lowest session priority
node.pause-on-idle     = false             # never suspend
session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0        # never timeout
```

The key change is `node.driver = false` combined with zero priorities. This prevents
the capture adapter from becoming a graph driver, which was the architect's hypothesis
for why the original adapter disrupted the PipeWire graph (it would try to drive the
graph clock from the USBStreamer's capture stream, conflicting with the loopback sink's
clock).

**`50-usbstreamer-disable-acp.conf` (new):**
Disables WirePlumber's automatic ALSA Card Profile (ACP) detection for the USBStreamer.
Without this, WirePlumber would auto-create duplex nodes (capture + playback) that
conflict with CamillaDSP's exclusive playback access. Same approach as
`51-loopback-disable-acp.conf` for the Loopback device.

### 9c: Capture-Active Test 1 — 30 Seconds (PASS with 2 Audible Glitches)

**Config:** Capture-only adapter enabled, PipeWire restarted to load new config.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 30s |
| JACK xruns | 0 |
| CamillaDSP anomalies | 0 |
| Processing load | min=13.9%, max=70.6%, mean=24.8% |
| Buffer level | min=917, max=949, mean=931.6 |
| Temperature | 69.6C |
| Throttle | 0x80000 (soft limit history, not active) |

The monitor reported PASS (0 xruns, 0 anomalies). However, **the owner heard 2 audible
glitches** during this run. The processing load spiked to 70.6% -- significantly higher
than the typical 15-25% range -- suggesting a transient scheduling event.

The 70.6% peak load is notable: it exceeds the P99 from US-003 T3b (59.95%) and
approaches the buffer exhaustion threshold. At chunksize 256 (5.33ms deadline), a
70.6% load leaves only 1.57ms of slack.

The throttle flag 0x80000 indicates a soft thermal limit was hit at some point in the
past but was not actively throttling during this test.

### 9d: Capture-Active Test 2 — 120 Seconds, No PipeWire Restart (PASS)

**Config:** Same capture-only adapter, but PipeWire was NOT restarted between tests.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 120s |
| JACK xruns | 0 |
| CamillaDSP anomalies | 0 |
| Processing load | min=13.9%, max=63.4%, mean=25.5% |
| Buffer level | min=825, max=886, mean=853.3 |
| Temperature | 69.6C |
| Throttle | 0x80000 (soft limit history, not active) |

No glitches heard. The peak load spike sequence shows a transient event:
32.8% -> 43.6% -> 63.4% -> 43.9% -> 20.1%. This spike is lower than the 70.6% peak
in the 30s test and resolved cleanly.

**Startup transient confirmed.** The 2 audible glitches from test 9c occurred
immediately after a PipeWire restart. Test 9d ran without a PipeWire restart and
produced no glitches. The audio engineer hypothesized that PipeWire's graph clock
needs time to settle after restart; the capture adapter's addition to the graph during
this settling period caused the transient load spikes that produced the glitches.

This is consistent with the US-003 T3c observation: CamillaDSP had an extra buffer
underrun at +38s after start with quantum 128, during the buffer fill-up phase. The
startup transient is a known sensitivity window.

**Implication for production:** CamillaDSP and PipeWire should be started and allowed
to stabilize before beginning performance. A PipeWire restart mid-performance could
cause brief glitches. This is acceptable -- PipeWire restarts are not expected during
normal operation.

### 9e: Buffer Drift Observation

In the 120s capture-active test (9d), the buffer level drifted from ~886 to ~825 over
the run. This is a gradual downward drift of ~61 units over 120 seconds (~0.5
units/second).

This drift is not alarming at 120s -- the buffer remains well above zero and the rate
is slow. However, it should be monitored in longer runs (30+ minutes). If the drift
continues linearly, the buffer would reach zero after approximately 28 minutes
(825 / 0.5 = 1650 seconds). This would cause an underrun.

Possible causes:
- Slight sample rate mismatch between the Loopback capture and USBStreamer playback
  (CamillaDSP's rate adjust mechanism should compensate, but rate_adjust was ~0)
- The capture adapter introducing a subtle timing perturbation to the graph
- Normal jitter that would self-correct over longer periods

This needs verification in a 30-minute capture-active stability test.

### 9f: RT Kernel Verification — 120 Seconds, Capture Active (PASS)

**Kernel:** `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` (PREEMPT_RT)
**Config:** Capture-only adapter enabled, CamillaDSP SCHED_FIFO 80, PipeWire quantum 256

Procedure:
1. Set `kernel=kernel8_rt.img` in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
2. Reboot
3. Restart CamillaDSP with SCHED_FIFO 80
4. Force PipeWire quantum to 256
5. Run 120s capture-active test

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 120s |
| JACK xruns | 0 |
| Callback gaps | 1 (startup only -- 10.7ms vs expected 5.3ms) |
| CamillaDSP anomalies | 0 |
| Processing load | min=13.8%, max=35.6%, mean=22.3% |
| Buffer level | min=396, max=758, mean=587.5 (trending UP) |
| Clipped samples | 0 |
| Temperature | 66.7C |
| Throttle | 0x0 (zero throttle events) |

The single startup callback gap (10.7ms = exactly 2x the expected 5.33ms interval)
is a benign one-missed-callback event at the first process cycle. This is the same
class of startup transient seen in all previous tests and resolves immediately.

**Result: PASS.**

### 9g: RT vs Non-RT Comparison

All three capture-active tests compared side by side:

| Metric | Non-RT 30s (post-restart) | Non-RT 120s (settled) | RT 120s |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Xruns | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Peak load | 70.6% | 63.4% | **35.6%** |
| Mean load | 24.8% | 25.5% | **22.3%** |
| Buffer min | 917 | 825 | 396 |
| Buffer max | 949 | 886 | 758 |
| Buffer mean | 931.6 | 853.3 | 587.5 |
| Buffer trend | N/A (30s) | Draining (~0.5/s) | **Rising** |
| Temperature | 69.6C | 69.6C | **66.7C** |
| Throttle | 0x80000 | 0x80000 | **0x0** |

Key findings:

1. **Peak load nearly halved on RT.** 35.6% vs 63-70% on stock PREEMPT. The 40-70%
   transient load spikes observed on non-RT are completely eliminated. PREEMPT_RT's
   deterministic scheduling prevents the scheduling jitter that caused these spikes.

2. **Buffer trends upward on RT.** On stock PREEMPT, the buffer drained from ~886 to
   ~825 over 120s (flagged in 9e as a potential 28-minute underrun risk). On RT, the
   buffer trends upward (396 -> 758), indicating better rate adjustment behavior.
   CamillaDSP's rate compensation works more effectively when scheduling is
   deterministic. The buffer drift concern from 9e does not apply to the RT kernel.

3. **3C cooler, zero throttle history.** 66.7C vs 69.6C, with throttle flag 0x0 vs
   0x80000. The RT kernel's more efficient scheduling reduces CPU waste from context
   switching and retry loops, lowering both temperature and power consumption.

4. **Strongly validates D-013.** PREEMPT_RT is unambiguously better for the audio
   workload: lower peak load, no scheduling spikes, stable buffer behavior, cooler
   thermals. The only blocker for production use remains F-012 (Reaper hard lockup
   on the RT kernel). For CamillaDSP + JACK client testing, the RT kernel is the
   preferred platform.

### 9h: Architect's Analysis

The architect provided the following interpretation of the RT vs non-RT results:

**Buffer behavior.** The rising buffer on RT (396 -> 758) shows CamillaDSP's adaptive
rate adjustment converging correctly under deterministic scheduling. The draining
buffer on non-RT (886 -> 825) shows rate adjustment failing to converge due to erratic
timing from scheduling jitter. The lower absolute buffer levels on RT are because
CamillaDSP was freshly started -- the buffer was still filling toward the normal ~1018
target. Given more time it would stabilize (US-003 T3b showed ~20 minutes to reach
steady state). The buffer drift concern raised in 9e is a non-RT artifact, not a
systemic issue.

**Processing load.** The non-RT 63-70% peak loads were NOT real DSP cost. They were
scheduling overhead and catch-up bursts: when the non-RT kernel preempts CamillaDSP's
processing thread, the subsequent callback must process accumulated samples in less
time, appearing as a load spike. The RT kernel shows the true DSP cost: ~35% peak,
~20% sustained. This leaves ample headroom for Reaper or Mixxx alongside CamillaDSP.

**Thermal behavior.** The throttle flag 0x80000 on non-RT indicates a soft temperature
limit was triggered since boot. The scheduling overhead (context switching, retry
loops, catch-up processing) was the primary thermal contributor -- not the DSP workload
itself. On RT, the flag is 0x0: the workload never reached the thermal threshold. The
DSP workload in isolation is thermally well-behaved; it was the non-deterministic
scheduling that pushed thermals into the danger zone.

**Recommendation.** Stay on the RT kernel for all remaining testing. RT provides a
clean measurement baseline -- any issues that appear are clearly isolatable without
"was it scheduling jitter?" as a confounding variable. The only exception is Reaper
testing, which requires the stock PREEMPT kernel until F-012 is resolved.

Note: F-012 means Reaper cannot be started on the RT kernel, so these results are
limited to the JACK test script + CamillaDSP path. A Reaper end-to-end test on RT
requires resolving F-012 first.

## Configuration Changes (Before / After)

### 20-usbstreamer.conf

**Before (duplex contention):** PipeWire adapter opening `hw:USBStreamer,0` for 8ch
capture with default driver/priority settings. Competed with CamillaDSP for USB
bandwidth.

**Phase 4 (disabled):** Renamed to `20-usbstreamer.conf.disabled` on the Pi.

**Phase 9 (capture-only, current):** Rewritten with split-access properties:
```
factory.name     = api.alsa.pcm.source    # capture only
node.driver      = false                   # not a graph driver
priority.driver  = 0                       # lowest priority
priority.session = 0
node.pause-on-idle     = false
session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0
```

### 50-usbstreamer-disable-acp.conf (new)

Disables WirePlumber ACP auto-detection for USBStreamer to prevent duplex node
creation that would conflict with CamillaDSP's exclusive playback access.
```
monitor.alsa.rules = [
  { matches = [ { device.name = "~alsa_card.usb-miniDSP_USBStreamer*" } ]
    actions = { update-props = { device.disabled = true } } }
]
```

### 25-loopback-8ch.conf

**Before:**
```
node.pause-on-idle = false
```

**After (hardened):**
```
node.pause-on-idle     = false
node.always-process    = true
session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0
priority.driver        = 2000
```

### CamillaDSP Priority

**Before:** `SCHED_OTHER`, nice -10
**After:** `SCHED_FIFO`, priority 80

Note: the `chrt` change is runtime-only. It needs to be persisted via systemd
service configuration or a startup script. [TBC -- how this will be persisted]

---

## Notes

1. **First end-to-end Reaper test.** All previous stability tests (US-003 T3b/T3c/T3e)
   used aplay feeding audio through the Loopback. This was the first test with Reaper
   in the loop, which exposed the PipeWire/CamillaDSP interaction issue.

2. **Thermal regression.** The full Reaper + PipeWire + CamillaDSP workload pushed
   thermals to 82.8C (vs 74.5C peak in T3b with aplay only). Removing the ada8200-in
   adapter brought it back to 73.0C. The flight case thermal test (T4) must be
   re-evaluated with the full production workload, not just aplay.

3. **Buffer level 860 vs 1018.** In US-003 T3b, CamillaDSP's buffer stabilized at
   ~1018. During the F-015 stall, the buffer was frozen at 860 across 10 samples.
   The lower value and frozen state indicate the pipeline had partially drained
   before the output-side blockage prevented further movement.

4. **QUANT=0, RATE=0 significance.** pw-top showing zero quantum and rate for all
   nodes means the PipeWire graph was not running a functional audio clock. This is
   abnormal -- in healthy operation, nodes show their configured quantum (e.g., 256)
   and rate (e.g., 48000). The graph-wide failure is consistent with the clock driver
   (USBStreamer-based) being disrupted by the USB contention.

5. **Error count ratio.** ada8200-in had ~11K errors vs loopback-8ch-sink's ~6K.
   The ~2:1 ratio suggests the capture adapter was failing first and more frequently,
   with downstream effects on the loopback sink. This supports the USB bandwidth
   contention theory where the capture stream's failures cascade through the graph.

## Phase 10: Quantum 128 Test — Hardware Floor Validation

### 10a. T6-128-idle: FAIL (catastrophic)

**Test:** 120s idle-system test at PipeWire quantum 128 on PREEMPT_RT kernel.
**Kernel:** 6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt (PREEMPT_RT)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| JACK xruns | 1750 (~14.6/sec) |
| Callback gaps | 189 (5.3-7.9ms vs expected 2.7ms) |
| CamillaDSP anomalies | 167 (repeatedly STALLED) |
| Buffer min / max / mean | 6 / 19 / 10.9 (>50% drain from peak) |
| Processing load min / max / mean | 25.9% / 50.8% / 36.4% |
| Temperature | 64.7C |
| Throttle flags | 0x0 (none) |

### 10b. Root Cause (architect analysis)

The failure is an I/O stack timing failure, NOT a CPU budget issue. Processing load
(36.4% mean, 50.8% peak) was well within budget. The 2.67ms deadline at quantum 128
is too tight for the combined latency of three components:

1. **VL805 USB controller jitter:** 50-200us per isochronous USB transfer (per audio
   engineer's microframe analysis). At quantum 128, this consumes 2-7.5% of the
   deadline per transfer, and there are multiple transfers per cycle (capture +
   playback on the USBStreamer).

2. **PipeWire graph cycle overhead:** Graph scheduling, node wakeup, and buffer
   management add fixed overhead per cycle that becomes proportionally larger at
   shorter quantum. At quantum 256, these overheads fit within the 5.33ms timing
   margin. At quantum 128, they exceed the 2.67ms margin.

3. **ALSA buffer management:** Ring buffer operations and interrupt handling through
   the Loopback + USBStreamer chain add latency that scales poorly with shorter
   periods.

The callback gaps (5.3-7.9ms vs 2.7ms expected) confirm the I/O stack cannot
consistently deliver data within the quantum 128 deadline. CamillaDSP repeatedly
entering STALLED state and the buffer draining to 6 (from a peak of 19) show the
pipeline is starving for data, not for CPU.

**Cross-references:**
- F-015 Phase 3: USB bandwidth contention on VL805 (same controller, different
  failure mode — bandwidth contention vs timing jitter)
- D-011: Live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256 (confirmed as production floor)
- Audio engineer T6 review: VL805 USB microframe jitter analysis (50-200us range,
  7-30% of a quantum 32 deadline)

### 10c. Conclusion

**D-011 (quantum 256) is validated as the hardware floor.** No further quantum
reduction is viable on the Pi 4B without hardware changes. The VL805 USB controller's
inherent jitter sets a hard lower bound that cannot be overcome by kernel tuning or
scheduling improvements.

**T6 test steps 2-8 cancelled.** Quantum 64 and 32 are physically impossible if
quantum 128 fails catastrophically. No D-021 (quantum reduction) decision needed.

Potential paths to quantum 128 (all require hardware changes):
- Pi 5 (native USB controller, no PCIe bridge)
- Dedicated USB audio interface with tighter isochronous timing
- Native I2S/ADAT interface bypassing USB entirely
