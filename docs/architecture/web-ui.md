# Web UI Architecture (D-020)

**Decision:** D-020 (2026-03-09)
**Covers:** US-022 (Web UI Platform), US-023 (Engineer Dashboard), US-018 (Singer IEM Self-Control)

## 1. Scope

This document defines the architecture for US-022 (Web UI Platform), US-023 (Engineer Dashboard), and US-018 (Singer IEM Self-Control). The Pi 4B serves data; browsers perform all heavy rendering.

## 2. Design Constraints

- Pi 4B: 4-core ARM Cortex-A72, 4 GB RAM. CamillaDSP + Reaper/Mixxx already consume 35-50% CPU in live mode.
- Owner directives: 30 fps spectrograph, browser GPU rendering, no audio compression, raw PCM, bandwidth cheaper than CPU.
- CamillaDSP websocket (port 1234) bound to 127.0.0.1 -- never exposed to network (US-000a).
- Python = control plane only. Python never touches the data plane. All DSP in CamillaDSP (C++), all visualization in the browser (JS).
- No SD card I/O from the web server's hot path (Python disk writes can stall I/O scheduler, cascading to CamillaDSP xruns).

## 3. Architecture Overview

Single-process FastAPI server (one uvicorn worker, SCHED_OTHER priority, HTTPS
via self-signed certificate -- see Section 12). Three WebSocket endpoints serve
all data, backed by four singleton collectors:

### WebSocket Endpoints

| Endpoint | Transport | Payload | Consumer | Rate |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| `/ws/monitoring` | JSON WebSocket | Levels (8ch capture RMS/peak + 8ch playback RMS/peak) + CamillaDSP status | Both roles | 10 Hz |
| `/ws/system` | JSON WebSocket | CPU, temperature, memory, PipeWire graph state, CamillaDSP health, per-process CPU | Engineer only | 1 Hz |
| `/ws/pcm` | Binary WebSocket | 3-channel interleaved float32 PCM (L main, R main, sub sum) | Engineer only | 48000 samples/s per ch |

### Backend Collectors

| Collector | Source | Poll rate | Feeds endpoint |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| CamillaDSPCollector | pycamilladsp `levels_since_last()` + status API (localhost:1234) | Levels: 20 Hz, Status: 2 Hz | `/ws/monitoring`, `/ws/system` |
| PcmStreamCollector | JACK client ring buffer (3 ch from CamillaDSP monitor taps) | Continuous (JACK callback) | `/ws/pcm` |
| SystemCollector | `/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/sys/class/thermal/`, `/proc/{pid}/stat` | 1 Hz | `/ws/system` |
| PipeWireCollector | `pw-top -b -n 2` (async subprocess) | 1 Hz | `/ws/system` |

In mock mode (`PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1`, default on macOS), real collectors are not
started and MockDataGenerator provides synthetic data. On the Pi
(`PI_AUDIO_MOCK=0`), all four collectors start on application startup.

See Section 12 for HTTPS requirement and Section 13 for collector
implementation details.

### Process Architecture

```

## 4. Streams 1-2: Level Meters (pycamilladsp)

**Source:** CamillaDSP's built-in per-channel signal level API via pycamilladsp.

```python
from camilladsp import CamillaClient

client = CamillaClient("127.0.0.1", 1234)
client.connect()

# One call returns all 4 arrays: capture_rms, capture_peak, playback_rms, playback_peak
levels = client.levels.levels_since_last()
# Returns dict with keys:
#   "capture_rms":    List[float]  -- 8 values, dB, pre-DSP (from Loopback input)
#   "capture_peak":   List[float]  -- 8 values, dB, pre-DSP
#   "playback_rms":   List[float]  -- 8 values, dB, post-DSP (to USBStreamer output)
#   "playback_peak":  List[float]  -- 8 values, dB, post-DSP
```

This provides 16 meters total: 8 capture (pre-DSP) + 8 playback (post-DSP). Values are in dB, already computed by CamillaDSP's C++ engine. The `levels_since_last()` method returns levels accumulated since the previous call, ideal for polling.

**Channel mapping (playback = post-DSP, what reaches the speakers/IEMs):**

| Ch | Playback output | Meter label |
|----|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Left wideband | L Main |
| 2 | Right wideband | R Main |
| 3 | Subwoofer 1 | Sub 1 |
| 4 | Subwoofer 2 | Sub 2 |
| 5 | Engineer HP L | Eng HP L |
| 6 | Engineer HP R | Eng HP R |
| 7 | Singer IEM L | IEM L |
| 8 | Singer IEM R | IEM R |

**Channel mapping (capture = pre-DSP, what enters CamillaDSP from Loopback):**

| Ch | Capture input | Meter label |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Loopback ch 1 (from Reaper/Mixxx L) | In L |
| 2 | Loopback ch 2 (from Reaper/Mixxx R) | In R |
| 3-8 | Loopback ch 3-8 | In 3-8 |

**ADA8200 input channels:** The ADA8200 has mic preamps on ch 1-2, but these are ADC inputs -- they feed INTO the USBStreamer's capture side, not into CamillaDSP's Loopback capture. CamillaDSP captures from the ALSA Loopback, not from the USBStreamer input. ADA8200 input monitoring requires a separate path (US-035 or future story). Channels 3-8 on the ADA8200 have no internal DAC-to-ADC loopback -- they show only noise floor.

**Meter visibility policy (updated 2026-03-11, TK-095):** All meters are always visible in fixed positions. Silent meters are dimmed (reduced opacity) rather than hidden. Auto-hide was rejected by owner/AE/AD consensus: spatial memory (knowing where each meter is by position) is more important than space savings in a live sound monitoring context. This overrides the original auto-show threshold design. The dashboard implementation dims meters below -60 dBFS but never removes them from the layout.

**Poll rate:** 20 Hz (50ms interval). The asyncio loop calls `client.levels.levels_since_last()` every 50ms and broadcasts the JSON to subscribed clients.

**Wire format (JSON):**

```json
{
  "type": "levels",
  "ts": 1709985600.123,
  "capture_rms": [-24.1, -24.3, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0],
  "capture_peak": [-18.2, -18.5, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0, -96.0],
  "playback_rms": [-27.3, -27.5, -30.1, -30.2, -24.1, -24.3, -28.0, -28.0],
  "playback_peak": [-21.0, -21.2, -24.5, -24.7, -18.2, -18.5, -22.0, -22.0]
}
```

**CPU cost:** Negligible. One pycamilladsp websocket call per 50ms. CamillaDSP computes the levels internally as part of its normal processing -- the API just reads them. Estimated < 0.05% CPU on Pi.

**Key advantage over JACK capture approach:** No JACK client needed for meters. No numpy RMS computation. No additional audio buffering. Stage 1 of the web UI delivers full 16-channel metering with zero JACK code.

### Dual-Source Metering (Stage 2+)

Once the spectrograph PCM stream is active (Stage 2), the browser has a second, independent source for level metering on the 3 spectrograph channels:

**Source A (Pi-side, primary):** pycamilladsp `levels_since_last()`. Available from Stage 1. Covers all 16 channels (8 capture + 8 playback). Computed by CamillaDSP's C++ engine. Zero additional bandwidth.

**Source B (browser-side, supplementary):** AudioWorklet computes peak and RMS from the raw PCM stream already being received for the spectrograph. Covers only the 3 spectrograph channels (L main, R main, sub sum). Computed in the browser's audio thread. Zero additional Pi CPU or bandwidth -- uses data already in flight.

**Source selection logic:**
- **Stage 1 (no JACK):** Source A only. All 16 meters from pycamilladsp.
- **Stage 2+ (JACK active, WebSocket connected):** Source A for all 16 meters. Source B available as a cross-check for the 3 spectrograph channels. The engineer dashboard may optionally display a "source health" indicator comparing A vs B for the overlapping channels -- a divergence > 3 dB sustained for > 2 seconds indicates a data path problem.
- **Source A unavailable (CamillaDSP disconnect):** For the 3 spectrograph channels, fall back to Source B if the PCM stream is still active. Remaining 13 channels show stale/disconnected. This provides partial metering during a CamillaDSP API outage as long as the JACK capture path is still running.
- **Source B unavailable (WebSocket disconnect or JACK failure):** No impact -- Source A is primary and independent of the PCM stream.

**Implementation note:** Source B peak/RMS computation is trivial in AudioWorklet -- iterate the float32 buffer per channel, track max absolute value (peak) and sum of squares (RMS). This runs in the audio thread at zero cost to the main JS thread. No additional WebAudio nodes needed beyond what the spectrograph already uses.

**Why not replace Source A with Source B?** Source B only covers 3 of 16 channels. The remaining 13 channels (5 playback outputs + 8 capture inputs minus the 3 spectrograph channels) have no PCM stream to the browser. Source A is the only option for full-coverage metering.

## 5. Stream 3: Spectrograph (Raw PCM Streaming)

**Source:** JACK client registered via PipeWire's JACK bridge. Captures from CamillaDSP's PipeWire monitor taps (`CamillaDSP 8ch Input:monitor_AUX0`, `monitor_AUX1`, `monitor_AUX2`). These are pre-DSP signals -- the same audio entering CamillaDSP from the Loopback.

**Channels:** 3 channels only (not 8). Per audio engineer:
- Ch 1: Left main (post-mix)
- Ch 2: Right main (post-mix)
- Ch 3: Mono sub sum (for low-frequency monitoring)

The JACK client runs a `process` callback that writes float32 samples into a lock-free ring buffer. An asyncio task reads from the ring buffer and sends binary WebSocket frames.

**Lock-free ring buffer design:**

```
JACK RT thread                    asyncio consumer
    |                                  |
    v                                  v
[write ptr] --> ring buffer --> [read ptr]
    |           (pre-allocated)        |
    |           (no malloc)            |
    v                                  v
  SCHED_FIFO                     SCHED_OTHER
  (PipeWire RT)                  (uvicorn)
```

- Ring buffer is pre-allocated at startup (e.g., 8192 frames x 3 channels x 4 bytes = 96 KB).
- JACK callback writes; asyncio consumer reads. Single-producer, single-consumer -- no locks needed.
- If the consumer falls behind, the write pointer overwrites old data (ring semantics). The consumer detects the gap and skips forward. No back-pressure to the audio thread.
- The JACK callback must complete in < 500 us (constraint 9). It performs only a memcpy into the ring buffer -- no allocation, no syscall, no Python object creation in the callback itself.

**Wire format (binary WebSocket):**

Each frame is a binary message containing:
- 4 bytes: frame count (uint32, little-endian)
- N x 3 x 4 bytes: interleaved float32 samples (3 channels)

Typical frame: 256 samples x 3 channels x 4 bytes = 3072 bytes + 4 byte header = 3076 bytes.
At 48 kHz / 256 samples per frame = 187.5 frames/sec = ~576 KB/s.

**Browser-side processing:**

```
Binary WebSocket frame
    |
    v
AudioWorklet (MessagePort receives Float32Arrays)
    |
    v
AnalyserNode (2048-point FFT, Blackman window, smoothingTimeConstant=0.8)
    |
    v
getByteFrequencyData() at 30 fps (requestAnimationFrame)
    |
    v
Canvas 2D or WebGL spectrograph renderer (GPU-accelerated)
```

The browser's `AnalyserNode` is a native C++ FFT implementation in the browser's audio engine. It runs on the audio thread, not the main JS thread. `smoothingTimeConstant=0.8` provides exponential smoothing with ~150ms time constant -- matching the audio engineer's recommendation of 2048-point FFT with smoothing factor 0.8.

**FFT parameters:**
- FFT size: 2048 points (gives 23.4 Hz bin width at 48 kHz -- adequate for spectrograph display)
- Window: Blackman (AnalyserNode default when smoothing is enabled)
- Output: 1024 magnitude bins (0 to Nyquist), log-frequency mapped for display
- Update rate: 30 fps (requestAnimationFrame)

**CPU cost (Pi side):** ~0.07% -- memcpy in JACK callback + asyncio send. No FFT, no numpy, no analysis.

**Subscription model:** Only engineer clients receive PCM data. Singer clients never subscribe to this path.

## 6. Stream 4: DSP Health

**Sources (via pycamilladsp, polled at 2 Hz):**
- CamillaDSP state: `client.general.state()`
- Processing load: `client.status.processing_load()`
- Buffer level: `client.status.buffer_level()`
- Clipped samples: `client.status.clipped_samples()`
- Rate adjust: `client.status.rate_adjust()`
- Active config: `client.general.config_file_path()`

**Wire format (JSON):**

```json
{
  "type": "dsp_health",
  "ts": 1709985600.123,
  "cdsp_state": "Running",
  "cdsp_load": 19.2,
  "cdsp_buffer": 8192,
  "cdsp_clipped": 0,
  "cdsp_rate_adj": 1.000000,
  "cdsp_config": "/etc/camilladsp/active.yml"
}
```

## 7. Stream 5: System Health

**Sources (polled at 1 Hz):**
- CPU temperature: `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`
- CPU usage: `/proc/stat` (computed delta between polls)
- Memory: `/proc/meminfo`
- PipeWire status: parse `pw-top` output for xrun count, quantum, driver info
- PipeWire errors: `pw-top` ERR column (nonzero = graph errors)
- ALSA device status: `/proc/asound/card*/stream*` for USB audio device state
- USB errors: `/sys/bus/usb/devices/*/error_count` for isochronous transfer errors

**Wire format (JSON):**

```json
{
  "type": "system_health",
  "ts": 1709985600.123,
  "cpu_temp": 62.3,
  "cpu_usage": 38.5,
  "mem_used_mb": 1024,
  "mem_total_mb": 3792,
  "pw_xruns": 0,
  "pw_quantum": 256,
  "pw_errors": 0,
  "alsa_usb_ok": true,
  "uptime_s": 3600
}
```

## 8. Stream 6: IEM Control (Reaper OSC)

**Protocol:** Reaper's built-in OSC control surface interface. Bidirectional UDP.

**Architecture:**

```
Singer browser                FastAPI                 Reaper
    |                           |                       |
    |-- WS: set IEM L to -6dB ->|                       |
    |                           |-- OSC /track/7/vol -->|
    |                           |                       |
    |                           |<-- OSC /track/7/vol --|  (feedback)
    |<-- WS: IEM L = -6dB -----|                       |
```

FastAPI runs a `python-osc` client that sends OSC messages to Reaper and receives feedback. The WebSocket relays level changes bidirectionally.

**Singer controls (per UX specialist wireframe):**
- Voice level (Reaper track feeding IEM ch 7/8 -- vocal mic)
- Backing track level (Reaper track feeding IEM ch 7/8 -- backing)
- Vocal cue level (Reaper track feeding IEM ch 7/8 -- cues)
- Master IEM volume (Reaper master for IEM bus)
- Mute toggle (long-press to confirm, per UX spec)

**Safety constraint:** Singer controls have a 0 dB ceiling. The singer can only attenuate, never boost above the engineer's set point. This is enforced server-side -- the FastAPI endpoint clamps values before sending OSC.

**Validation gate:** A21 (Reaper OSC on ARM Linux) must be validated with a 15-minute test on the Pi before Stage 4 implementation begins.

## 9. Authentication and Role-Based Access

**Roles:**
- `engineer`: Full access to all 6 streams + CamillaDSP parameter control (gain, mute)
- `singer`: Output level meters (Streams 1-2 playback side only) + IEM control (Stream 6). No spectrograph, no input meters, no health, no CamillaDSP control.

**Auth flow:**
1. Client sends role password via HTTPS POST `/auth/login` (or HTTP for LAN-only MVP)
2. Server validates against pre-configured role passwords (stored in server config, not in CamillaDSP)
3. Server returns a session token (random, time-limited)
4. Client includes token in WebSocket upgrade request
5. Server validates token and assigns role for the WebSocket session

**Security requirements (from security specialist review):**

| # | Severity | Requirement |
|---|----------|-------------|
| S1 | Critical | CamillaDSP websocket (port 1234) never exposed to browsers -- FastAPI proxies all access. Binding to 127.0.0.1 enforced at CamillaDSP and firewall level. |
| S2 | Critical | Role isolation enforced server-side -- singer WebSocket handler rejects subscription to engineer-only streams. Cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation. |
| S3 | Critical | IEM safety ceiling enforced server-side -- FastAPI clamps singer control values to [mute, 0 dB] before forwarding to Reaper OSC. Singer cannot boost above engineer's set point regardless of what the client sends. |
| S4 | High | Session tokens are time-limited (8 hours -- covers a full gig). Generated with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`. |
| S5 | High | No persistent tokens on singer devices -- session storage only, no localStorage. Token cleared on browser close. |
| S6 | High | HTTPS required before deployment on untrusted networks. Self-signed certificate acceptable for venue WiFi. HTTP permitted only for wired LAN-only development. |
| S7 | High | Rate limiting on `/auth/login` endpoint -- max 5 attempts per IP per minute. Prevents brute-force against role passwords. |
| S8 | Medium | All static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, fonts) bundled locally on the Pi. No CDN dependencies, no external resource loading, no Google Fonts. Consistent with US-034 (offline venue operation). |

**WebSocket subscription message:**

```json
{"subscribe": ["levels", "spectrograph", "dsp_health", "system_health"]}  // engineer
{"subscribe": ["levels", "iem"]}                                           // singer
```

Server validates subscription against role. Singer requesting "spectrograph" gets rejected.

## 10. UX Wireframes

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Key changes from original D-020 wireframe (TK-093, TK-095):**
- Monitor + System merged into dense single-screen Dashboard (owner feedback: "very little information density")
- 20px health bar with inline gauges replaces status bar
- Meter groups reordered: MAIN (capture ch 0-1, 48px wide, white/silver) | PA SENDS | MONITOR SENDS | SOURCE (capture ch 2-7)
- MAIN meters are the primary visual reference -- wider bars, first position
- SOURCE meters always visible but dimmed when silent (auto-hide rejected, see meter visibility policy above)
- SPL hero + LUFS in 180px right panel (Stage 2 placeholder)
- System tab kept as fallback diagnostic view
- No spectrograph until Stage 2 PCM data available

(Note: `####` represents white/silver-colored meter bars for MAIN; `====` represents standard green/yellow/red meter bars for outputs. SOURCE meters use cyan when active.)

**Abbreviated label legend (updated TK-095):**

| Group | Label | Full name | CamillaDSP channel |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| MAIN | ML | Main left | Capture ch 1 (Loopback from Reaper/Mixxx L) |
| MAIN | MR | Main right | Capture ch 2 (Loopback from Reaper/Mixxx R) |
| PA SENDS | SatL | Satellite left | Playback ch 1 (left wideband speaker) |
| PA SENDS | SatR | Satellite right | Playback ch 2 (right wideband speaker) |
| PA SENDS | S1 | Subwoofer 1 | Playback ch 3 |
| PA SENDS | S2 | Subwoofer 2 | Playback ch 4 |
| MON SENDS | EL | Engineer headphone left | Playback ch 5 |
| MON SENDS | ER | Engineer headphone right | Playback ch 6 |
| MON SENDS | IL | Singer IEM left | Playback ch 7 |
| MON SENDS | IR | Singer IEM right | Playback ch 8 |
| SOURCE | Src3-8 | Source channels 3-8 | Capture ch 3-8 (Loopback routing, often silent) |

**Note:** MAIN meters show capture channels 0-1 (the primary mix bus from Reaper/Mixxx). Both DJ and live modes capture from ALSA Loopback (`hw:Loopback,1,0`). ADA8200 physical inputs (vocal mic, spare) are separate -- metered via a future JACK client (US-035, TK-096).

**Layout principles (updated TK-093 + TK-095):**
- Meters follow signal-flow order in 4 functional groups: MAIN (capture ch 0-1, 48px wide, white/silver) | PA SENDS (playback ch 1-4, green/yellow/red) | MONITOR SENDS (playback ch 5-8, green/yellow/red) | SOURCE (capture ch 2-7, cyan #00BCD4, dimmed when silent).
- MAIN meters are wider (48px vs 36px) and use a distinct white/silver color scheme to visually anchor the display. They represent the primary mix bus entering CamillaDSP.
- All meters always visible in fixed positions. Silent meters are dimmed, never hidden. Spatial memory is more important than space savings for live sound monitoring (owner/AE/AD consensus, TK-095).
- 20px health bar above meters provides condensed system health with inline gauges (CPU, temp, memory, DSP load). Expandable to full System view for diagnostics.
- SPL hero display (42px font) + LUFS readouts in 180px right panel. Stage 2 placeholder.
- Spectrograph deferred to Stage 2 (requires JACK PCM data). No empty space reserved -- meters use full available height.
- Each meter shows peak hold indicator (thin line above current bar, decays over 1.5s).
- Clip indicators: "CLIP" text above meter turns red when peak exceeds -0.5 dBFS. Auto-clears after 3 seconds (F-1 fix).
- dB scale labels at 0, -6, -12, -24, -48 dB on left edge, aligned with meter bars.

**Future extensibility:** When ADA8200 input monitoring is added (US-035, TK-096), a fifth group "INPUTS" appears to the left of MAIN. Signal-flow order becomes: INPUTS | MAIN | PA SENDS | MONITOR SENDS | SOURCE. This adds 2 meters (VOC = vocal mic, SPARE = spare mic/line) via a dedicated JACK client reading USBStreamer capture channels. Requires Pi + USBStreamer + ADA8200 hardware -- not pure software.

**Interaction:**
- Gain faders: slider per output channel (engineer only). Sends gain change to CamillaDSP via pycamilladsp.
- Mute toggles: per output channel. Visual indicator (red "M" badge on muted channel).
- No drag-and-drop, no modal dialogs during performance. All controls are direct manipulation.

**Layout principles:**
- Portrait only, single screen, no scrolling.
- 4 sliders with large touch targets (minimum 48px hit area per WCAG).
- Dark theme -- usable in dim stage lighting. High contrast text on dark background.
- Mute toggle at bottom -- requires long-press (500ms) to activate/deactivate. Prevents accidental muting during performance.
- Slider debounce: 50ms. Changes sent via WebSocket after debounce, server forwards to Reaper OSC.
- IEM L/R meters at the bottom show current output level (from pycamilladsp playback ch 7-8). Read-only feedback so the singer sees the effect of her adjustments.
- No access to PA controls, no spectrograph, no system health. Singer sees ONLY what she needs.

### Disconnected States

**Engineer disconnect:**
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Audio Workstation -- Engineer             [DISCONNECTED] [Retry] |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                    |
|  All meters frozen at last known values, dimmed to 50% opacity    |
|  Spectrograph frozen, "DISCONNECTED" overlay                      |
|  Status bar shows "Connection lost at HH:MM:SS -- retrying..."   |
|  Auto-reconnect every 3 seconds. On reconnect, server pushes     |
|  full state snapshot (constraint 5: server-authoritative state).  |
|                                                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Singer disconnect:**
```
+---------------------------+
|  IEM Monitor   [OFFLINE]  |
+---------------------------+
|                           |
|  Connection lost.         |
|  Your IEM mix is          |
|  unchanged.               |
|                           |
|  Reconnecting...          |
|                           |
|  [Last update: HH:MM:SS] |
+---------------------------+
```

Key behavior: on disconnect, the singer sees a clear "your mix is unchanged" message. The IEM mix in Reaper continues at its last settings -- losing the WebSocket does NOT mute the IEM. Auto-reconnect every 3 seconds. On reconnect, server pushes current slider positions from Reaper OSC feedback.

## 11. Operational Constraints

1. **Single uvicorn worker.** No multiprocessing. The JACK client, pycamilladsp client, and OSC client all live in the same process. asyncio event loop handles concurrency.

2. **SCHED_OTHER priority.** The web server runs at default scheduling priority. It must never compete with CamillaDSP (SCHED_FIFO 80) or PipeWire (SCHED_FIFO 83-88) for CPU time.

3. **No disk I/O in hot paths.** Log to journald (already in memory on this system). No file writes from WebSocket handlers or polling loops.

4. **Graceful degradation.** If CamillaDSP is unreachable, the web UI shows stale data with a "disconnected" indicator. It does not crash or spin-retry aggressively.

5. **Server-authoritative state.** On WebSocket reconnect, server pushes full state snapshot. Client never trusts cached values from a previous session.

6. **Subscription-based WebSocket.** Each client subscribes only to the streams it needs. Singer receives ~1 KB/s (levels JSON only). Engineer receives ~581 KB/s (levels + PCM + health). Unsubscribed streams consume zero bandwidth.

7. **Font bundling.** All fonts bundled in the static assets. No Google Fonts or external font loading.

8. **WebSocket send queue cap (AD residual risk).** Each WebSocket connection has a send queue capped at 32 frames. If the consumer (browser) falls behind (e.g., WiFi degradation), the server drops oldest frames rather than buffering unboundedly. This prevents memory growth on the Pi. The JACK ring buffer is independent -- audio capture continues regardless of WebSocket state.

9. **JACK callback benchmark (AD residual risk).** Before deploying the spectrograph (Stage 2), the JACK process callback must be benchmarked on the Pi to confirm it completes in < 500 microseconds. The callback performs only a memcpy into the ring buffer. If the benchmark fails (unlikely for a 3-channel memcpy of 3072 bytes), the spectrograph path must be redesigned. This is a gate for Stage 2, not Stage 1.

## 12. HTTPS Requirement (D-032)

The Web Audio API's `AudioWorklet` interface requires a **secure context**
(HTTPS or `localhost`) per the W3C specification. In a non-secure context
(plain HTTP to a non-localhost host), the `audioContext.audioWorklet` property
is `undefined` and the spectrum analyzer cannot function. This was discovered
during the D-020 PoC validation (see `docs/lab-notes/D-020-poc-validation.md`,
Step 5).

**Decision (D-032):** The web UI runs over HTTPS using a self-signed
certificate. This is sufficient for a LAN-only deployment where the operator
controls the network.

### Production Configuration

The systemd service (`configs/systemd/user/pi4-audio-webui.service`) starts
uvicorn with SSL:

```
ExecStart=.../uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
    --ssl-keyfile /home/ela/web-ui/key.pem \
    --ssl-certfile /home/ela/web-ui/cert.pem
```

**Certificate generation (one-time setup on Pi):**

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
    -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=mugge"
```

The 10-year validity avoids cert expiry during venue use. The `-nodes` flag
produces an unencrypted private key (acceptable for a LAN-only service on a
single-user system).

**Browser access:** The first connection to `https://mugge:8080` will show a
self-signed certificate warning. The operator accepts the certificate once per
browser. After acceptance, the AudioWorklet loads normally and the spectrum
analyzer functions.

**Development (macOS):** `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1` mode runs without HTTPS. The
AudioWorklet is not used in mock mode (no PCM streaming), so the secure
context requirement does not apply. For development with real PCM, use
`localhost` (which is a secure context per W3C spec).

### Environment Variables

The systemd service sets the following environment:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `PI_AUDIO_MOCK` | `0` | Enable real collectors (default `1` on macOS) |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `/run/user/1000` | Required for PipeWire/JACK socket access |
| `JACK_NO_START_SERVER` | `1` | Prevent JACK from auto-starting a server (PipeWire provides the JACK interface) |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/pipewire-0.3/jack` | PipeWire's JACK compatibility library (required for `python-jack-client` to use PipeWire) |

### Priority and Resource Isolation

The service runs at `Nice=10` (lower priority than default processes) to
ensure it never competes with CamillaDSP (SCHED_FIFO 80) or PipeWire
(SCHED_FIFO 83-88) for CPU time. This is in addition to the SCHED_OTHER
scheduling class (constraint 2 in Section 11).

## 13. Backend Collector Architecture

Four singleton collector classes poll system data sources on the Pi.
Collectors are instantiated and started during FastAPI application startup
(in `app/main.py`) when `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=0`. Each collector runs its own
asyncio polling loop and exposes a snapshot method for the WebSocket handlers
to read.

### CamillaDSPCollector (`app/collectors/camilladsp_collector.py`)

**Source:** pycamilladsp client connecting to CamillaDSP's websocket API at
`127.0.0.1:1234`.

**Two polling loops:**
- **Levels at 20 Hz (50ms):** Calls `client.levels.levels_since_last()` for
  8-channel capture/playback RMS and peak values. Drives the `/ws/monitoring`
  endpoint's level meter data.
- **Status at 2 Hz (500ms):** Calls `client.general.state()`,
  `client.status.processing_load()`, `client.status.buffer_level()`,
  `client.status.clipped_samples()`, `client.status.rate_adjust()`, and
  `client.rate.capture()`. Drives the DSP health section of both
  `/ws/monitoring` and `/ws/system`.

**Connection lifecycle:** Connect on startup. If CamillaDSP is unreachable,
reconnect with exponential backoff (1s -> 2s -> 4s -> 8s, capped at 15s).
During disconnection, snapshots include `cdsp_connected: false` and all
levels default to -120 dB so the frontend shows a disconnected state with
meters at minimum.

**Graceful degradation:** All 8 channels are zero-padded to 8 if CamillaDSP
reports fewer (e.g., during config transitions).

### PcmStreamCollector (`app/collectors/pcm_collector.py`)

**Source:** JACK client registered via PipeWire's JACK bridge. Captures from
CamillaDSP's monitor taps (`CamillaDSP.*:monitor.*` port pattern).

**Ring buffer:** Pre-allocated numpy array, 8192 frames x 3 channels x
float32 = 96 KB. Single-producer (JACK RT callback), single-consumer
(asyncio WebSocket sender). Lock-free: the JACK callback does only numpy
slice assignment (C-level memcpy) and integer arithmetic. No logging, no
malloc, no syscalls in the RT callback path.

**Per-client streaming:** Each connected WebSocket client in `/ws/pcm` gets
its own read position into the shared ring buffer. Multiple clients consume
independently. If a client falls behind, the write pointer overwrites old
data (ring semantics).

**Binary frame format:** 4-byte LE uint32 header (frame count, always 256) +
interleaved float32 samples (256 frames x 3 channels x 4 bytes = 3072 bytes).
Total frame size: 3076 bytes. At 48 kHz / 256 frames per chunk = 187.5
chunks/sec = ~576 KB/s per client.

**Platform guard:** On non-Linux platforms (`sys.platform != "linux"`), the
JACK client is not started and PCM streaming is unavailable. The `/ws/pcm`
endpoint returns close code 1008.

### SystemCollector (`app/collectors/system_collector.py`)

**Source:** Direct reads from `/proc` and `/sys` pseudo-filesystems.

**Poll rate:** 1 Hz.

**Metrics collected:**
- CPU temperature: `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp` (millidegrees C)
- Per-core CPU usage: `/proc/stat` (delta between polls, idle vs total ticks)
- Memory: `/proc/meminfo` (MemTotal, MemAvailable)
- Per-process CPU: `/proc/{pid}/comm` + `/proc/{pid}/stat` for tracked
  processes (mixxx, reaper, camilladsp, pipewire, labwc)

**Platform fallback:** On non-Linux (macOS development), returns zero values
for all metrics.

### PipeWireCollector (`app/collectors/pipewire_collector.py`)

**Source:** Async subprocess execution of `pw-top -b -n 2` with a 3-second
timeout. Uses `-n 2` because the first pass of `pw-top` outputs all zeros;
the second pass has real values.

**Poll rate:** 1 Hz.

**Metrics extracted:**
- PipeWire quantum (buffer size)
- Sample rate
- Total xruns (ERR column)
- Graph state (running/unknown)
- Scheduling policy and RT priority for PipeWire and CamillaDSP processes
  (read from `/proc/{pid}/stat` fields 38-39)

**Platform fallback:** On non-Linux, returns defaults (quantum 256, rate
48000, SCHED_OTHER).

## 14. Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Level Meters + System Health (no JACK, no OSC)
- FastAPI server with static file serving
- pycamilladsp polling for level meters (Streams 1-2)
- DSP health polling (Stream 4) and system health polling (Stream 5)
- Authentication and role-based access
- Engineer dashboard: 16 meters (8 capture + 8 playback) + health panel
- Singer view: IEM L/R meters (read-only, playback ch 7-8)
- **Gate:** Server runs for 1 hour alongside CamillaDSP + Reaper with 0 xruns and < 2% additional CPU.

### Stage 2: Spectrograph (adds JACK)
- JACK client with ring buffer for PCM capture
- Binary WebSocket streaming (Stream 3)
- Browser AudioWorklet + AnalyserNode + spectrograph renderer
- **Pre-gate:** JACK callback benchmark confirms < 500 us (constraint 9)
- **Gate:** 30-minute test with spectrograph active -- 0 xruns, < 0.3% total web UI CPU.

### Stage 3: CamillaDSP Control (adds write operations)
- Engineer gain/mute controls via pycamilladsp write API
- Configuration display (active config, filter files, mode)
- **Gate:** Security specialist review of write path isolation.

### Stage 4: IEM Control (adds Reaper OSC)
- **Pre-gate:** A21 validated (Reaper OSC works on ARM Linux, 15-minute test)
- python-osc client for Reaper communication
- Singer web UI: 4 sliders + mute toggle (per wireframe in section 10)
- Server-side 0 dB ceiling enforcement
- **Gate:** Audio engineer verifies IEM control does not affect PA path.

## 15. Dashboard Review Findings (2026-03-11)

The Stage 1 dashboard underwent three review cycles after TK-093 (dense redesign). Architecturally significant findings are captured here; task-level tracking is in `docs/project/tasks.md` (TK-095).

### Design Decisions from Review

**Auto-hide rejection (owner/AE/AD consensus).** The original D-020 spec called for auto-hiding capture channels 3-8 when their peak was below -60 dBFS. This was rejected during the AE dashboard review. In live sound monitoring, the engineer learns meter positions by spatial memory -- a meter that appears and disappears breaks that mental model. All meters are always visible; silent ones are dimmed. This is now the permanent design principle for all meter groups.

**MAIN meters as primary visual anchor.** The AE clarified that capture channels 0-1 (the Loopback mix bus from Reaper/Mixxx) are the most-watched meters during operation. They were promoted from generic "In L / In R" labels to "ML / MR" (MAIN), placed first in the layout, rendered at 48px width (vs 36px for other meters), and given a distinct white/silver color scheme. This makes the primary mix bus immediately identifiable.

**Signal path clarification.** Both DJ mode and live mode capture from the ALSA Loopback device (`hw:Loopback,1,0`). CamillaDSP does NOT capture from the USBStreamer input. The ADA8200's mic preamps on channels 1-2 are ADC inputs that feed the USBStreamer's capture side -- they are a separate signal path entirely. Dashboard meters for ADA8200 inputs require a dedicated JACK client reading USBStreamer capture channels (US-035, TK-096). This is not a Stage 1 feature.

**SPL metering design.** The UMIK-1 measurement microphone provides continuous SPL data (dBA and dBC). The SPL hero display occupies the right panel with a 42px readout, above LUFS placeholders. The full SPL metering design (including A/C weighting filters, Leq computation, and UMIK-1 calibration pipeline) is documented in `docs/architecture/web-ui-monitoring-plan.md` Section 3.

### Bug Fixes Applied (TK-095)

| ID | Severity | Issue | Resolution |
|----|----------|-------|------------|
| F-1 | Critical | Clip indicators stuck red (no auto-clear) | Auto-clear after 3s (CLIP_LATCH_MS). Only activates when peak >= -0.5 dBFS. |
| F-3 | High | Auto-hide not working / rejected | All meters always visible, silent ones dimmed. Design change, not bug fix. |
| F-6 | Low | dB readout color thresholds too aggressive | Thresholds corrected: green < -12 dB, yellow -12 to -3 dB, red > -3 dB. |
| F-7 | High | Temperature 62.6C shown red | Threshold raised to 75C (Pi 4 thermal spec). Green < 65C, yellow 65-75C, red > 75C. |
| F-8 | Medium | Total CPU 156% confusing | Normalized display: sum divided by 4 cores, shown as single percentage. |
| F-9 | Low | "Running" text not color-coded | CamillaDSP state color-coded: green=Running, red=other states. |

### Deferred Items

| ID | Description | Rationale |
|----|-------------|-----------|
| M-1 | RMS vs peak dual-bar per meter | Professional standard but adds visual complexity. Defer to Stage 2. |
| M-2 | Mono sum indicator for sub mix | Useful for sub verification. Defer to Stage 2 spectrograph phase. |
| M-3 | USB device status (USBStreamer/UMIK-1) | Requires ALSA device polling. Defer to system health expansion. |
| M-4 | USB isochronous error count | Early warning metric. Defer to system health expansion. |
| F-UX-103 | Temperature redundancy (health bar + System view) | Low priority cosmetic. |
| F-UX-104 | Uptime shows page load time, not system uptime | Needs server-side uptime in system health stream. |
| F-UX-107 | CLIP indicator wastes 10px height | Very low priority. Fixed height aids layout stability. |
| F-UX-108 | "FIFO 88/80" opaque to non-experts | Very low priority. Expert-audience tool. |

## 16. Resource Budget Summary

| Component | CPU (Pi) | Bandwidth (per engineer client) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Level meter polling (20 Hz) | < 0.05% | ~1 KB/s (JSON) |
| Spectrograph capture + send | ~0.07% | ~576 KB/s (raw PCM) |
| DSP health polling (2 Hz) | < 0.02% | ~0.3 KB/s (JSON) |
| System health polling (1 Hz) | < 0.02% | ~0.2 KB/s (JSON) |
| IEM OSC relay | < 0.01% | < 0.1 KB/s (event-driven) |
| FastAPI + uvicorn overhead | ~0.1% | -- |
| **Total** | **~0.27%** | **~578 KB/s** |

Singer client bandwidth: ~1 KB/s (levels JSON only, playback ch 7-8).
