# Introduction to the Pi 4B Audio Workstation

This is the entry point to the project's documentation. It explains what
the system is, how it works at a high level, and where to find detailed
information on each topic.

For the repository README (quick overview, project status, repo layout),
see [README.md](../../README.md) at the project root.

## What This Project Is

A portable audio workstation built on a Raspberry Pi 4B, replacing a
Windows PC in a flight case. The system handles crossover filtering, room
correction, multi-channel routing, and time alignment for live sound --
all running on a $75 single-board computer.

The workstation serves two use cases on identical hardware:

**DJ/PA mode** -- Psytrance events. Mixxx plays tracks through a 2+2
speaker system (stereo mains + two independently corrected subwoofers).
The system applies per-venue room correction using combined minimum-phase
FIR filters that preserve kick drum transient fidelity. PipeWire quantum
1024 prioritizes CPU efficiency (~21ms PA path latency).

**Live vocal mode** -- Cole Porter performances with a singer and backing
tracks. Reaper plays pre-recorded accompaniment while the singer performs
live. She wears in-ear monitors and also hears the PA acoustically. The
system keeps the PA path delay to ~5.3ms to prevent distracting slapback.
PipeWire quantum 256 prioritizes low latency.

Both modes share the same audio processing pipeline (PipeWire filter-chain
convolver). The only differences are the source application and the PipeWire
quantum (set at runtime via `pw-metadata`).

## Software Stack

| Software | Role |
|----------|------|
| PipeWire 1.4.9 | Audio server, routing, AND DSP engine. Provides JACK bridge for applications, manages graph scheduling, and runs the filter-chain convolver (FFTW3/NEON) for all FIR processing. Runs at SCHED_FIFO/88. |
| Mixxx 2.5.0 | DJ software (DJ/PA mode). Connects via `pw-jack`. |
| Reaper 7.64 | Digital audio workstation (live vocal mode). |
| Python 3 + scipy/numpy | Automated room correction pipeline (measurement, filter generation, deployment). |
| labwc | Wayland compositor. Hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (D-022). |
| wayvnc | Remote desktop access (VNC over Wayland). |

### Signal Path

```
Application (Mixxx or Reaper)
  |
  | pw-jack JACK bridge
  v
PipeWire (SCHED_FIFO/88)
  |
  |-- Speaker channels (1-4):
  |     filter-chain convolver
  |     - FIR convolution (16,384 taps per channel)
  |     - Combined crossover + room correction
  |
  |-- Monitor channels (5-8):
  |     Direct PipeWire links (bypass convolver)
  |
  v
USBStreamer -> ADA8200 -> Amplifiers -> Speakers
```

Note: The system previously used CamillaDSP as an external DSP engine via
ALSA Loopback (pre-D-040). PipeWire's built-in convolver replaced it,
eliminating the loopback bridge and reducing DJ-mode latency from ~109ms
to ~21ms.

reference.

### Other

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [SETUP-MANUAL.md](../../SETUP-MANUAL.md) | Original comprehensive setup manual (~2200 lines). **Obsolete as authoritative reference** -- retained for historical context. Ground truth is now CLAUDE.md > Pi > configs/ > docs/project/. |
| [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) | AI assistant context file. Contains the authoritative "Pi Hardware State" section and project summary. |

---

## Ground Truth Hierarchy

When sources disagree, this is the order of authority for the current
state of the Pi:

1. **CLAUDE.md** "Pi Hardware State" section -- authoritative summary
2. **The Pi itself** -- actual running state (via SSH)
3. **`configs/` directory** -- version-controlled deployed configs
4. **`docs/project/`** -- decisions, status, defects, tasks
5. **SETUP-MANUAL.md** -- **OBSOLETE**, not kept in sync

This hierarchy is established by D-023 (Reproducible Test Protocol).

---

## Key Decisions

These decisions shape the overall system design. The full decision log is
at [docs/project/decisions.md](../project/decisions.md).

| Decision | Summary |
|----------|---------|
| D-001 | Combined minimum-phase FIR filters (16,384 taps) instead of IIR crossover |
| D-002 / D-011 / D-040 | Dual quantum: 1024 (DJ, ~21ms PA) vs 256 (live, ~5.3ms PA). Single PipeWire graph -- no separate DSP chunksize. |
| D-009 | Cut-only correction filters with -0.5dB safety margin |
| D-013 | PREEMPT_RT kernel mandatory for PA-connected operation (safety) |
| D-022 | Hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`) |
| D-023 | Reproducible test protocol: version-controlled state, scripted tests, deploy-and-reboot |
| D-027 | `pw-jack` is the permanent libjack solution (update-alternatives incompatible with ldconfig) |
