## D-001: Combined minimum-phase FIR filters instead of IIR crossover (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Evaluating crossover implementation for a system that needs both crossover and per-venue room correction. IIR crossovers are the current digital PA standard; high-end FIR processors (Lake, Powersoft) typically max out at ~1,024 taps.

**Decision:** Use combined minimum-phase FIR filters (16,384 taps) that integrate crossover slope and room correction into a single convolution per output channel. Do not use IIR (Linkwitz-Riley) crossovers.

**Rationale:** 16x the tap count of commercial FIR processors enables combining crossover and room correction into a single convolution — halves processing stages, reduces numerical artifacts, co-optimizes both functions. Secondary: ~1-2ms group delay vs ~4ms for LR4 IIR at 80Hz (lower is objectively better, though audibility of the difference is debatable). Tertiary: no pre-ringing, unlike linear-phase FIR (~6ms pre-echo at 80Hz).

**Impact:** Crossover frequency cannot be adjusted in CamillaDSP YAML. Filter regeneration required for any crossover change. CamillaDSP loads combined WAV files.

## D-002: Dual chunksize — 2048 (DJ) vs 512 (Live) (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Live mode singer perceives slapback from PA if total path latency exceeds ~25ms.

**Decision:** DJ/PA mode uses chunksize 2048 (42.7ms latency, efficient). Live mode uses chunksize 512 (10.7ms CamillaDSP latency, ~18ms total PA path).

**Rationale:** Singer's IEM path is direct (~5ms). She also hears PA acoustically. At chunksize 2048, PA path = ~48ms — severe slapback. At chunksize 512, PA path = ~18ms — below 25ms perception threshold.

**Impact:** Live mode doubles CamillaDSP CPU cost. Offset by Reaper being lighter than Mixxx.

## D-003: 16,384-tap FIR filters at 48kHz (2026-03-08)

**Context:** FIR filter length determines the lowest frequency that can be effectively corrected.

**Decision:** 16,384 taps at 48kHz (341ms, 2.9Hz frequency resolution). Fallback: 8,192 taps if CPU budget is too tight.

**Rationale:** At 48kHz, 16,384 taps gives 10.2 cycles at 30Hz (solid), 6.8 cycles at 20Hz (adequate with headroom). 8,192 taps gives 3.4 cycles at 20Hz (marginal but viable for live venues).

**Impact:** CPU cost scales with tap count. Must validate on Pi 4B hardware (test T1).

## D-004: Two independent subwoofers with per-sub correction (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Different sub placement = different room interaction. A single correction filter cannot serve both.

**Decision:** Each subwoofer gets its own FIR correction filter, delay value, and gain trim. Both receive the same L+R mono sum as source material.

**Rationale:** Subs near walls/corners have strong room coupling that varies dramatically with position. Each sub needs independent measurement and correction.

**Impact:** Four combined FIR filters total (left HP, right HP, sub1 LP, sub2 LP). Four delay values. Measurement pipeline must measure each output independently.

## D-005: Team composition — Live Audio Engineer and Technical Writer on core team (2026-03-08)

**Context:** This is an audio engineering project where signal processing decisions are central, and comprehensive documentation is a primary deliverable.

**Decision:** Add a Live Audio Engineer as a core advisory team member. Promote the Technical Writer from worker to core team member. No Security Specialist (personal project, no secrets or auth).

**Rationale:** Audio Engineer ensures every technical decision serves the goal of a successful live event. Keeps track of signal processing requirements and is part of the approval process. Technical Writer maintains a comprehensive documentation suite (introduction, how-tos, handbook, theory, lab notes) and records experiment results during testing.

**Impact:** Both roles have blocking authority. Audio Engineer blocks on signal processing errors. Technical Writer blocks on documentation inaccuracy that could cause incorrect configuration.

## D-006: Expanded team — Security Specialist, UX Specialist, Product Owner; Architect gets real-time performance scope (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Supersedes D-005's "No Security Specialist" clause. The system is a headless Pi on venue WiFi networks with exposed services — reputation risk is real even without nation-state threats. Headless operation across multiple MIDI controllers needs dedicated interaction design. Story intake from owner inputs needs a dedicated Product Owner role.

**Decision:**
1. Add Security Specialist to core team, scoped to availability/integrity for live performance (not full enterprise security). Threat model: casual attackers at venue networks, service exposure, reputation protection.
2. Add UI/UX Specialist to core team, responsible for interaction design across MIDI controllers, headless operations, displays, web UIs, and remote access.
3. Add Product Owner to core team (Coordination category), responsible for translating owner inputs into structured stories with acceptance criteria.
4. Expand Architect's scope to include real-time performance on constrained hardware (CPU budgets, memory management, thermal planning, buffer sizing, systemd resource management).

**Rationale:** Security: a headless Pi with SSH, VNC, CamillaDSP websocket, and possibly web UIs on untrusted venue WiFi is a real attack surface — proportionate hardening is needed. UX: the interaction model spans MIDI grids, DJ controllers, headless systemd, web UIs, VNC — designing coherent workflows needs dedicated attention. Product Owner: structured story intake prevents requirements from being lost or misinterpreted. Architect real-time scope: Pi 4B with 4GB RAM under sustained DSP load is fundamentally a real-time performance challenge.

**Impact:** Security Specialist has blocking authority on network exposure and service hardening. UX Specialist has blocking authority on interaction design that could disrupt live performance. Product Owner has no blocking authority but flags incomplete/ambiguous AC. Consultation matrix updated with all new consultation rules.

## D-007: D-001, D-002, D-003 are conditional pending hardware validation (2026-03-08)

**Context:** AD review identified that D-001 (minimum-phase FIR), D-002 (dual chunksize 2048/512), and D-003 (16,384-tap FIR) are stated as binding decisions but depend on hardware validation tests (T1-T5) that have not yet been run on the Pi 4B.

**Decision:** D-001, D-002, and D-003 remain the design intent and working assumptions for all planning and story writing. However, they are explicitly conditional on US-001 (CPU benchmarks), US-002 (latency measurement), and US-003 (stability tests) passing. If any test fails, the affected decision will be revisited with a new superseding decision (e.g., D-003 may be superseded by a decision to use 8,192 taps if T1b fails).

**Rationale:** The decision tree in CLAUDE.md already documents fallback paths (8,192 taps, chunksize 1024, etc.). This decision formalizes that the current parameters are not yet validated on hardware and may change based on test results.

**Impact:** No change to current story AC or planning. All stories should continue to reference D-001/D-002/D-003 as the target configuration. The test stories (US-001, US-002, US-003) include decision tree outcomes in their DoD — if a fallback is triggered, a new decision entry will be added.

## D-008: Per-venue measurement — all corrections regenerated fresh at each location (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Room correction filters and time alignment values are venue-specific. Platform behavior (USB timing, driver updates, kernel changes) may also shift between gigs. Running measurements at each venue ensures corrections are valid for the actual conditions, not stale data from a previous location or system state.

**Decision:** The measurement pipeline is an operational tool, run at every gig setup. Filter coefficients and delay values are ephemeral derived artifacts, regenerated fresh at each venue. The pipeline includes a platform self-diagnostic (loopback self-test) to detect system-level drift. Filters and delays are deployed as an atomic matched set — never update one without the other.

**Rationale:** (1) Different venues have different acoustics. (2) System updates could shift USB/ADAT timing. (3) Regenerating fresh removes stale-config bugs. (4) Historical measurements enable regression detection.

**Impact:** Filter WAV files under `/etc/camilladsp/coeffs/` are runtime-generated, never version-controlled. Pipeline scripts + parameters (calibration files, target curves, crossover settings) are the version-controlled source. CamillaDSP config YAML is generated from templates with measured delay values — the deployed config is a derived artifact.

## D-009: Zero-gain correction filters — cut only, -0.5dB safety margin (2026-03-08)

**Context:** Psytrance tracks routinely hit -0.5 LUFS (near 0 dBFS digital full scale). Any filter gain above 0dB at any frequency will cause hard clipping — immediately and painfully audible on a PA system.

**Decision:** All correction filters must have gain ≤ -0.5dB at every frequency. Correction operates by cut only: room peaks are attenuated, nulls are left uncorrected. Target curves are applied as relative attenuation (cut mid/treble relative to bass), not as boost. Every generated filter is programmatically verified before deployment — no frequency bin may exceed -0.5dB. The CamillaDSP pipeline gain structure must be audited: no stage may produce net gain.

**Rationale:** (1) Zero headroom in source material makes any boost unsafe. (2) Cut-only correction is 80%+ as effective as boost+cut — room peaks are the dominant audible problem. (3) Nulls should not be boosted regardless of headroom — they're position-dependent and boost wastes power. (4) This aligns with best practice in professional room correction. (5) The -0.5dB safety margin accounts for FIR truncation ripple, Gibbs phenomenon, and numerical precision.

**Impact:** Supersedes the +12dB max boost in CLAUDE.md. Target curve implementation changes from "boost bass" to "cut mid/treble relative to bass" — same perceptual result at lower digital level, compensated by analog gain. Lower SPL tiers require more amplifier gain.

## D-010: Speaker profiles and configurable crossover (2026-03-08)

**Context:** The system may be used with different speaker configurations at different venues — different crossover frequencies, sealed vs ported subs, potentially 3-way speakers.

**Decision:** Crossover frequency, slope, speaker type (sealed/ported), and target SPL are per-venue parameters stored in named speaker profiles (YAML files). Ported sub protection (subsonic rolloff below port tuning frequency) is mandatory. Three-way support is Phase 2 (after 2-way pipeline is proven), DJ mode only (channel budget constraint). Speaker profiles are pre-defined with a custom override option.

**Rationale:** (1) Different speaker combinations need different crossover points. (2) Ported subs need protection below port tuning to prevent mechanical damage. (3) 3-way requires 6 speaker channels, leaving only 2 for monitoring — incompatible with live mode's IEM requirement. (4) Pre-defined profiles reduce setup errors at gigs.

**Impact:** Pipeline must accept speaker profile as input. CamillaDSP config generation is templated based on profile. Filter generation adapts crossover shape to profile parameters. The earlier hardcoded 80Hz crossover (D-001) becomes the default value, not a fixed requirement.

## D-011: Live mode chunksize 256 + PipeWire quantum 256 (2026-03-08)

**Context:** US-002 latency measurements revealed that CamillaDSP adds exactly 2 chunks of latency (capture buffer fill + playback buffer drain, FIR convolution completes within the same processing cycle). PipeWire at quantum 1024 adds ~21ms per traversal. The original D-002 target of chunksize 512 yields ~31ms bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist — tolerable but at the upper limit for Cole Porter vocal work where precise timing with backing tracks matters. Additionally, the architect discovered that CamillaDSP holds exclusive ALSA access to all 8 USBStreamer channels, making the D-002 assumption of "IEM bypasses CamillaDSP" physically impossible.

**Decision:** Live mode uses chunksize 256 + PipeWire quantum 256 (~21ms bone-to-electronic target). DJ mode unchanged: chunksize 2048 + quantum 1024. All 8 audio channels route through CamillaDSP — IEM channels (7-8) are passthrough (no FIR processing). Fallback: chunksize 512 + quantum 256 (~31ms). Stretch goal: quantum 128 (~18ms).

**Rationale:** (1) US-001 benchmarks confirmed chunksize 256 with 16k taps at only 19.25% processing load — well within budget. (2) 21ms bone-to-electronic is in the "noticeable separation" range but safe for musical performance. 31ms (chunksize 512) crosses into "distinct delayed return" territory. (3) CamillaDSP's exclusive ALSA access means all channels must transit CamillaDSP regardless — IEM passthrough adds zero latency penalty vs the PA path, collapsing the slapback model to bone-conduction vs electronics only. (4) PipeWire quantum 256 at 48kHz = 5.3ms per hop, appropriate for the live use case.

**Impact:** Supersedes D-002 for live mode parameters. DJ mode unchanged. All CamillaDSP configs must route 8 channels (IEM as passthrough on ch 6-7). PipeWire needs per-mode quantum configuration: 10-audio-settings.conf with quantum 256 for live mode, 1024 for DJ mode. SETUP-MANUAL must be updated with new chunksize values and routing architecture.

## D-012: Flight case thermal management — active cooling on Pi mandatory (2026-03-08)

**Context:** US-003 T3b measured 74.5C peak at ~20C ambient (open-air, CamillaDSP only). The Pi 4B throttles at 80C. At venue temperatures (25-32C) in a closed flight case, the Pi will throttle without active cooling, causing xruns at chunksize 256.

**Decision:**
1. Active cooling (fan) on the Pi is mandatory. A 40-50mm fan directed at the SoC provides ~15C reduction, bringing the thermal equilibrium to ~70C at 32C ambient.
2. A heatsink on the Pi 4B SoC is mandatory (if not already present).
3. T4 must test with the amplifier running at moderate output to measure actual case-internal temperature near the Pi. The amp is Class D (85-90% efficient) with its own active cooling, so waste heat contribution to Pi airspace is expected to be modest (~3-5C) but must be validated.
4. Amp thermal isolation: evaluate during T4. Class D efficiency and the amp's own fan may make compartmentalization unnecessary. If T4 shows case ambient near the Pi exceeds 35C with the amp running, revisit with compartment divider or directed airflow.

**Rationale:** Open-air thermal equilibrium: 72C at 20C ambient (52C delta). Closed case adds ~3-5C from restricted airflow. Venue ambient: 25-32C. Without Pi fan: 80-87C projected — thermal throttling certain. With Pi fan (~15C delta reduction): 67-73C projected — adequate margin. Class D amp at moderate output (~200W): ~30W waste heat, mostly exhausted by amp's own fan, contributing +3-5C to nearby case ambient.

**Impact:** Flight case design must include a fan for the Pi (USB-powered, always-on). Heatsink required. T4 test protocol includes amp at moderate output. Amp compartmentalization is a contingency, not a baseline requirement.

## D-013: PREEMPT_RT kernel mandatory for production use (2026-03-08)

**Context:** The system drives a PA capable of dangerous SPL levels through amplifiers with 4x450W output. A scheduling delay on stock PREEMPT (which has no formal worst-case bound) could cause a buffer underrun, producing a full-scale transient through the amplifier chain. US-003 T3c confirmed a steady-state underrun at quantum 128 on stock PREEMPT — the kernel cannot guarantee the 5.33ms processing deadline under all conditions. The PREEMPT_RT kernel (`linux-image-6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`) is available as a matching package in Trixie repos, making the switch a zero-risk package install with the stock kernel retained as fallback.

**Classification:** Hard real-time with human safety implications. The system drives amplifiers capable of dangerous SPL at audience position. An uncontrolled transient is a hearing damage risk.

**Decision:** PREEMPT_RT kernel is mandatory for any PA-connected operation. Stock PREEMPT is retained for development and benchmarking only. The RT kernel must be installed and validated (US-003 T3e) before the system is connected to amplifiers at any venue.

**Rationale:** (1) The system drives amplifiers capable of dangerous SPL — an uncontrolled transient from a buffer underrun is a hearing damage risk, making this a hard real-time system with human safety implications. (2) Zero xruns is a mandatory operational target, not a stretch goal. (3) Stock PREEMPT has no formal scheduling latency bound — empirically adequate in 30-minute tests but with no guarantee for multi-hour production use. (4) PREEMPT_RT provides bounded worst-case scheduling latency, converting the system from "probably fine" to "provably adequate." (5) The RT kernel is available as a matching package install — same kernel version 6.12.47, zero-risk to deploy with stock kernel as fallback. (6) D-013 addresses the scheduling failure mode; the gain structure procedure during measurement setup (D-009 cut-only filters, calibrated analog gain) addresses other failure modes.

**Impact:** Supersedes any prior "no PREEMPT_RT needed" assumptions. RT kernel must be installed before any PA-connected operation. US-003 T3e procedure changes from "compare and decide" to "install, validate, deploy." Stock PREEMPT retained on the SD card for development/benchmarking. Enables future buffer size revisit (quantum 128) with formal scheduling guarantees. CLAUDE.md Pi Hardware State must be updated to reflect RT kernel after T3e validation.

## D-014: Hardware limiter — deferred (2026-03-08)

**Context:** The architect recommended a hardware limiter between the Pi's audio output and the amplifiers as a last-resort safety device against full-scale transients from software failure (buffer underruns, DSP crashes, configuration errors).

**Decision:** Deferred. The current system uses a calibrated gain structure procedure during measurement setup (D-009 cut-only correction, analog gain calibration) which addresses the risk for the current speaker/amplifier configuration. D-013 (PREEMPT_RT) eliminates the scheduling failure mode. A hardware limiter becomes required when the system drives PAs capable of >110dB SPL at audience position.

**Rationale:** (1) Owner assessment: hardware limiter makes sense for high-power PAs but is not needed for current setup. (2) Calibrated gain structure procedure sets analog gain conservatively during measurement, limiting maximum SPL even in a full-scale digital transient scenario. (3) D-013 (PREEMPT_RT) provides bounded scheduling, eliminating the most likely transient source. (4) Cost and complexity of a hardware limiter is disproportionate for the current power level.

**Impact:** No immediate action required. Revisit when system scales to higher-power PAs (>110dB SPL capability at audience position). The gain structure procedure is the primary safety mechanism until then.

## D-015: Stock PREEMPT kernel for development — PREEMPT_RT deferred pending Reaper bug fix (2026-03-08)

**Context:** TK-016 Reaper smoke test revealed that Reaper causes a reproducible hard kernel lockup on the PREEMPT_RT kernel (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`). The lockup is instant (within ~1 minute of launch), leaves no trace in the kernel journal, and requires a hardware watchdog reset (~2 minutes) to recover. Tested 4 times: 3 crashes on RT kernel (including with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`), 1 successful 90-second run on stock PREEMPT kernel. The crash is not OOM (3.4 GB free), not GPU-specific (software rendering doesn't help), and not a userspace issue (systemd watchdog stops being fed, confirming kernel-level lockup). The BCM2835 hardware watchdog (1-minute timeout) triggers the eventual reboot.

**Bug:** F-012 — Reaper triggers hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Suspected cause: Reaper's real-time thread scheduling (SCHED_FIFO at high priority) interacts with PREEMPT_RT's fully preemptible locking to produce a kernel deadlock. Requires investigation with a proper test rig (serial console for kernel oops capture, scriptable power supply for automated reboot after crashes).

**Decision:** Continue development and validation on the stock PREEMPT kernel (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8`). D-013 remains the production target but is blocked until F-012 is resolved. The RT kernel is retained on the SD card.

**Rationale:** (1) Reaper is required for live vocal mode — it cannot be replaced without significant workflow disruption. (2) The RT kernel bug needs a proper test rig (serial console, scriptable PSU) for investigation — crashing the Pi repeatedly over SSH is destructive and uninformative. (3) Stock PREEMPT showed zero xruns in 30-minute stability tests at quantum 256 with 33.8% processing load (T3b). (4) The risk accepted is that stock PREEMPT has no formal worst-case scheduling bound — "works in testing" does not guarantee "works in 4-hour gigs." (5) Compensating controls: D-009 (cut-only filters), D-014 (hardware limiter path), gain structure calibration, monitoring daemon. (6) The `chrt -o 0` workaround (SCHED_OTHER) was tested and also crashed — the lockup is not caused by Reaper's RT priority scheduling.

**Fix-before-shipping:** F-012 must be resolved before the system is used at a live event with PA-connected amplifiers. Resolution path: (a) build test rig with serial console + scriptable PSU, (b) capture kernel oops/panic from Reaper crash, (c) report upstream or find workaround (PAM rtprio cap, cgroup constraints, Reaper configuration — note: `chrt -o 0` already ruled out), (d) validate Reaper + PREEMPT_RT stability for 30 minutes, (e) reinstate D-013 as fully operational.

**Impact:** Supersedes D-013 for the development phase. All current testing proceeds on stock PREEMPT. TK-016, TK-020, TK-021 are unblocked on the stock kernel. The system is NOT approved for PA-connected production use until F-012 is resolved and D-013 is reinstated.

## D-016: Measurement pipeline uses both REW and Python (2026-03-09)

**Context:** TK-004 asked whether the room correction measurement pipeline (US-008 through US-013) should use REW (Room EQ Wizard) or a pure Python implementation. REW is a proven, mature measurement tool with Java dependency. Pure Python gives full control and avoids the JVM but requires implementing sweep generation, recording, deconvolution, and analysis from scratch.

**Decision:** Both. REW for exploratory and ad-hoc measurement work. Python (scipy/numpy/soundfile) for the automated room correction pipeline.

**Rationale:** (1) REW is the industry standard for room measurement -- using it for exploratory work leverages existing documentation, community knowledge, and proven algorithms. (2) The automated pipeline must be scriptable, headless, and integrated with CamillaDSP's websocket API -- REW's GUI-centric workflow is not suitable for one-button automation (D-008). (3) Python gives full control over the minimum-phase FIR generation chain (D-001), psychoacoustic smoothing, and regularization (D-009). (4) REW serves as an independent verification tool for the Python pipeline's output. (5) TK-011 (install REW on Pi ARM) remains relevant as a quick setup task.

**Impact:** US-008 (measurement script) through US-013 (verification) will be implemented in Python. REW is a recommended but optional tool for ad-hoc verification and exploratory measurements. TK-011 (REW on Pi ARM) is still useful but no longer on the critical path.

## D-017: Offline venue operation — no Internet required at runtime (2026-03-09)

**Context:** Many venues have no Internet access, unreliable WiFi, or captive portals that prevent normal connectivity. The system must be fully operational at any venue regardless of Internet availability. The owner stated: "we need to set this up in a way that works in venues without Internet connection."

**Decision:** All venue-time functionality must work without Internet. The Pi operates on a local network (Pi as WiFi AP, portable router, or venue LAN) for operator/performer device access. No Internet-reachable services are required at runtime. Setup-time operations (package installs, OS updates, software downloads) may use Internet when available but are never performed at a venue.

**Rationale:** (1) The core audio stack (PipeWire, CamillaDSP, Mixxx, Reaper) is entirely local — no Internet dependency. (2) The room correction pipeline (US-008-US-013) runs entirely on the Pi — all computation is local. (3) The web UI (US-022/US-023/US-018) serves from the Pi to devices on the local network — no external assets needed if properly bundled. (4) Remote desktop (wayvnc per D-018) is entirely local — no relay server dependency. (5) The system must work with zero venue infrastructure — worst case, the operator brings a portable WiFi router or the Pi runs as an access point. (6) DNS resolution failures on an Internet-less network can cause unexpected timeouts in local services if not handled.

**Impact:** Cross-cutting constraint affecting multiple stories: US-000a (wayvnc + SSH for remote access, no Internet-dependent services), US-022 (all web UI assets must be bundled locally — no CDN dependencies), US-018 (singer phone connects via local network), US-031 (full rehearsal must be tested without Internet). A28 assumption added: system must function with zero venue network infrastructure (Pi creates its own network if needed).

## D-018: wayvnc replaces RustDesk as sole remote desktop solution (2026-03-09)

**Context:** RustDesk was selected as the primary remote desktop tool (owner preference from 2026-03-08). During venue testing, a confirmed unfixable limitation was discovered: RustDesk on Wayland cannot relay mouse input to the compositor. The mouse cursor is visible in the RustDesk client but clicks and movements do not reach labwc or any application running under it. This makes RustDesk unusable for interactive GUI control (Mixxx, Reaper, CamillaDSP GUI). wayvnc, which speaks the native Wayland remote desktop protocol, provides full mouse and keyboard input without this limitation.

**Decision:** wayvnc is the sole remote desktop solution. RustDesk is removed from the software stack entirely. Remote access is via wayvnc (GUI interaction) and SSH (terminal, file transfer, tunneling). The VNC port (TCP 5900) replaces RustDesk ports (TCP 21118, UDP 21119) in the firewall configuration.

**Rationale:** (1) RustDesk's Wayland mouse input limitation is confirmed unfixable — it is an architectural constraint of how RustDesk captures the compositor's framebuffer without input injection. (2) wayvnc integrates natively with labwc via the wlr-export-dmabuf and wlr-virtual-pointer protocols — full input support is inherent. (3) wayvnc is already installed and working (confirmed with Remmina on Linux). (4) Removing RustDesk simplifies the stack: fewer services, fewer firewall rules, fewer ports, one less application to maintain. (5) SSH provides file transfer (scp/sftp) and terminal access — RustDesk's file transfer feature is not needed. (6) D-017 (offline venue operation) is better served by wayvnc, which has zero Internet dependency by design.

**Impact:** Supersedes owner preference "Remote desktop: RustDesk (not VNC)" from 2026-03-08. All RustDesk references removed from stories and documentation. US-000 AC updated (RustDesk installation removed). US-000a AC updated (firewall rules changed to VNC port 5900, RustDesk hardening removed). US-000b references updated. US-032 scope clarified (wayvnc is now the primary tool, not a fallback). A24 superseded (VNC is now the primary method, not a fallback).
