# Measurement UI: User Flows and Screen Designs

Design document for the Measure view in the D-020 web UI. Covers user flows,
technical procedures, screen wireframes, and integration with the existing room
correction pipeline (`scripts/room-correction/`) and web UI
(`scripts/web-ui/`).

**Status:** Design complete. Implementation deferred per backlog priorities.

**Contributors:**
- Product Owner: synthesis and story framing
- UX Specialist: interaction design, wireframes, navigation structure
- Audio Engineer: technical measurement procedures

**References:**

- `scripts/web-ui/` -- existing SPA with Monitor, System, Measure (stub), MIDI
  (stub)

## 1. Navigation Structure

The Measure view uses sub-tabs below the main navigation bar, providing 5
distinct contexts within the measurement domain.

```
Main nav:  [Monitor]  [Measure]  [System]  [MIDI]
                |
Sub-tabs:  [Speakers]  [Calibrate]  [Measure]  [Results]  [Presets]
```

### Why sub-tabs (not a wizard)

The user often needs to jump between contexts during a measurement session.
For example: start a measurement, notice a speaker definition is wrong, fix it
in the Speakers tab, come back to Measure. A wizard locks the user into a
linear path. Sub-tabs allow free navigation while the Calibrate and Measure
tabs use an embedded stepper to track progress within their multi-step
workflows.

### Sub-tab responsibilities

| Sub-tab | Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Speakers | CRUD form | Manage speaker identity definitions |
| Calibrate | Guided stepper | Near-field speaker calibration (one-time per speaker) |
| Measure | Guided stepper | Full room correction workflow (per venue/installation) |
| Results | Browse/analyze | Review frequency responses, verification, deploy |
| Presets | List browser | Store, recall, compare measurement presets |

### Responsive behavior

- Desktop (1920x1080 kiosk): sub-tabs as horizontal row below main nav
- Phone/tablet: sub-tabs scroll horizontally, content stacks vertically

---

## 2. Workflows Overview

Four measurement workflows map to the sub-tabs. Each is a subset of the full
pipeline.

### Workflow 1: Speaker Calibration (one-time per new speaker)

**When:** Adding a new speaker model to the system (e.g., Bose PS28 III).
**Purpose:** Measure the speaker's own frequency response and derive the
speaker EQ compensation profile.
**Sub-tab:** Calibrate
**Pipeline stages used:** Sweep generation, deconvolution, speaker EQ derivation

### Workflow 2: Room Setup (per venue or new installation)

**When:** Setting up at a new venue or measuring a fixed installation for the
first time.
**Purpose:** Full room correction -- gain staging, multi-position sweeps,
correction filters, crossover combination, verification.
**Sub-tab:** Measure -> Results -> (optionally) Presets
**Pipeline stages used:** All 7 stages of `runner.py`

### Workflow 3: Quick Verify (mid-gig check)

**When:** Mid-performance sanity check, or after recalling an installation
preset.
**Purpose:** Single-position verification sweep with current filters active.
Compares against target curve.
**Sub-tab:** Measure (abbreviated) -> Results
**Pipeline stages used:** Sweep, deconvolution, verification only

### Workflow 4: Time Alignment Only (speakers moved, room unchanged)

**When:** Speakers repositioned in a known room (e.g., moved for a different
stage layout).
**Purpose:** Re-measure propagation delays and update time alignment without
regenerating correction filters.
**Sub-tab:** Measure (abbreviated) -> Results
**Pipeline stages used:** Sweep, deconvolution, time alignment only

## 4. Calibrate Sub-Tab

### Purpose

Near-field measurement of individual speaker drivers to create the speaker EQ
compensation profile. This is a one-time procedure per speaker model.

### Stepper: 3 stages

```

+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Stage 2: Measure

Two sub-phases: near-field sweep, then 1-meter sweep.

**Near-field phase:**

```
|  NEAR-FIELD MEASUREMENT                                           |
|  Mic distance: 8-16mm from cone, on-axis                         |
|                                                                    |
|  Measuring... [===================-------] 72%  3.6s / 5.0s      |
|                                                                    |
|  [live waveform visualization]                                     |
```

After near-field completes:

```
|  NEAR-FIELD COMPLETE                                              |
|                                                                    |
|  Now move the UMIK-1 to 1 meter from the speaker, on-axis.       |
|  Point the mic at the acoustic center of the driver.              |
|                                                                    |
|  The 1m measurement will be repeated 3 times with slight          |
|  repositioning to average out placement error.                    |
|                                                                    |
|  [Begin 1-Meter Measurement]                                      |
```

### Stage 3: Review

Shows the spliced frequency response and derived EQ parameters.

```

|  Center:   82 Hz (measured)                                        |
|  Gain:     +9.7 dB (measured)                                     |
|  Q:        0.68 (fitted)                                           |
|                                                                    |
|  Mandatory HPF: 45 Hz (from speaker identity)                     |
|  Global attenuation required: -10.2 dB (D-029)                   |
|                                                                    |
|  [Accept and Save to Speaker Identity]  [Re-measure]              |
```

Accepting updates the speaker identity's EQ compensation fields with the
measured values. The user can override the derived values in the Speakers tab
if needed.

```

The speaker checkboxes allow the engineer to exclude speakers if needed (e.g.,
measuring only subs after repositioning them, without re-measuring mains). The
cross-pattern diagram gives the user a spatial overview of all positions before
starting. Estimated time is computed from speakers x positions x sweep duration.

### Stage 2: Measurement (multi-position)

The measurement stage is a nested loop: for each mic position, sweep all 4
speaker channels. The user physically moves the mic between positions.

**Position indicator strip:** Four small squares at the top right show overall
position progress. `*` = completed, `>` = current, blank = pending. This gives
at-a-glance progress without competing with the per-speaker detail below.

**Between positions -- mic-move prompt with cross-pattern diagram:**

When all speakers are done at a position, the per-speaker list clears and a
mic-move prompt takes over. The cross-pattern diagram removes ambiguity about
where to move the mic. The Continue button is a deliberate pause point --
prevents sweeps from playing while the mic is in transit.

|  [Continue]                              [Abort Measurement]       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Phone layout for mic-move prompt:** The cross-pattern diagram is replaced
with a compact numbered list:

```
+---------------------------+
| MOVE MIC TO POSITION 3    |
|                           |
| 1. Center ......... DONE  |
| 2. Right (50cm) ... DONE  |
| 3. Front (50cm) ... NEXT  |
| 4. Left (50cm) .... --    |
|                           |
| Keep mic at ear height.   |
|                           |
| [Continue]                |
+---------------------------+
```

**Abort semantics:** During a mic-move prompt, [Abort Measurement] discards
all measurements from all positions (partial data from a subset of positions
is not useful for spatial averaging). The label is more explicit than the
in-sweep [ABORT] because the consequences are larger. Still a single press --
the data has not been deployed, so no safety gate is needed.

### Phone layout for Stage 2

Stepper becomes compact single-line: "Step 2/7: Measure" with progress dots.
Per-speaker list is full-width. Live waveform is omitted on phone (the
engineer's phone is for monitoring progress while standing near a speaker, not
for watching waveforms). Position indicator strip and position label remain
visible. Mic-move prompts use the compact numbered list format (see above).

### Chart specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| X axis | 20Hz - 20kHz, logarithmic |
| Y axis | -24dB to +6dB, linear |
| Rendering | Canvas 2D (consistent with monitor.js meters) |
| Raw response | Red dashed line |
| Corrected response | Green solid line |
| Target curve | White dotted line |
| D-009 limit | Yellow horizontal line at -0.5dB |

### Comparison modes

- **Before/After:** Raw measurement (red) vs corrected (green)
- **Multi-position overlay:** Individual position responses overlaid (for
  advanced users to inspect spatial variation before averaging)
- **Preset comparison:** Current measurement vs loaded preset

### All-speakers summary

A compact grid view accessible above the chart:

```
| Main Left  [ALL PASS]  Main Right [ALL PASS] |
| Sub 1      [ALL PASS]  Sub 2      [1 FAIL]   |
```

Tapping a speaker loads the detailed single-speaker view.

### Verification acceptance criteria (from AE)

| Frequency range | Tolerance | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 30-200 Hz | +/- 3 dB | Room modes partially correctable |
| 200-2000 Hz | +/- 2 dB | Smooth range, tighter tolerance achievable |
| 2000-16000 Hz | +/- 3 dB | HF varies with position |
| < 30 Hz, > 16 kHz | Not evaluated | Below correction range / above UMIK-1 accuracy |

**STOP condition:** If any channel deviates > 6dB from target at any frequency
(30-16kHz), correction has made things worse. System flags this and offers
revert to dirac (passthrough) filters.

### Phone layout

Chart is full-width with pinch-to-zoom. Legend toggles become pill buttons

## 7. Deploy Confirmation Flow

### Three-gate sequence (safety-critical)

Deploying filters requires CamillaDSP restart, which causes USBStreamer
transients through the 4x450W amplifier chain. This is the most
safety-critical interaction in the Measure view.

### Gate 1: Verification (automatic)

The Deploy button is only visible when ALL verification checks pass for ALL
speakers. If any check fails:

```
DEPLOY BLOCKED: 1 verification failure in Sub 2.
Fix before deploying.
```

There is no override. This maps to `deploy.py`'s `if not verified: raise
RuntimeError` safety interlock.

### Gate 2: Safety Acknowledgment (user action)

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|  WARNING: SPEAKER DAMAGE RISK                              |
|                                                            |
|  Deploying filters will restart CamillaDSP. This causes    |
|  the USBStreamer to produce full-scale transients through   |
|  the 4x450W amplifier chain.                               |
|                                                            |
|  Before proceeding:                                         |
|  [ ] I have turned off the amplifiers OR lowered volume     |
|      to safe levels                                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The checkbox implements the mandatory owner-approval step from the 2026-03-10
safety rule in CLAUDE.md. The warning text is explicit about the physical risk.

### Gate 3: Final Confirmation

```
[Deploy Now]   (disabled until Gate 2 checkbox is checked)
[Cancel]
```

Deploy Now button is styled red (danger action), distinct from the standard
blue accent.

### Action semantics

| Action | Type | Effect | Safety gates |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| Load (venue) | Non-destructive | Loads measurement data into Results for comparison | None |
| Recall (installation) | Destructive | Deploys stored filters | Full 3-gate deploy flow |
| Verify Now | Non-destructive | Runs verification sweep against stored preset | None |
| Compare | Non-destructive | Opens Results with preset data for side-by-side | None |
| Store Current | Non-destructive | Saves current measurement to preset directory | Name prompt |
| Delete | Destructive | Removes preset data and filters | Confirm dialog |

### Key rules

- Venue presets: **Load only, never Recall.** D-008 mandates fresh measurement
  per venue. Loading is for comparison/regression analysis.
- Installation presets: **Recall flows into Verify.** Per D-028, verification
  measurement after recall is mandatory, not optional. The UI chains
  Recall -> Deploy -> auto-prompt Verify Now.
- "Last verified" date: turns amber if > 7 days old (gentle nudge).

### Storage directory structure (from architect)

## 9. Technical Measurement Procedures

### 9.1 Near-Field Speaker Calibration (Calibrate sub-tab)

**Purpose:** Isolate the speaker's own frequency response from room effects.

**Procedure:**

1. **Near-field measurement (below 300Hz):**
   - Place UMIK-1 within 5-10% of the driver diameter from the cone surface
   - For a 6.5" woofer (165mm): 8-16mm from cone, on-axis
   - At this distance, direct-to-reflected ratio exceeds 30dB
   - Valid from driver resonant frequency (Fs) up to ~300Hz

2. **1-meter on-axis measurement (above 300Hz):**
   - Place UMIK-1 at 1 meter from the speaker, on-axis
   - Point mic at acoustic center of the driver
   - Repeat 3 times with slight repositioning, average results
   - Valid from ~300Hz to 20kHz (per IEC 61672 reference distance)

3. **Splice:**
   - Pipeline splices near-field (below ~250Hz) and 1m (above ~250Hz)
   - Automatic splice -- user does not adjust splice point
   - Standard practice (REW's "merge near-field" does this)

4. **Derive speaker EQ:**
   - Compare measured response against flat reference
   - Deviations become the speaker EQ compensation parameters
   - D-029 compliance: boost offset by global attenuation upstream
   - Pipeline verifies total gain <= -0.5dB at every frequency after EQ

**For multi-driver speakers:** Measure each driver type separately (e.g.,
Bose satellite 6.5" full-range + Bose sub 5.25" isobaric pair).

### 9.2 Gain Staging (Measure sub-tab, Stage 1)

**Purpose:** Set output levels for safe, accurate measurement.

**Procedure:**

1. Load CamillaDSP passthrough config (dirac filters, 0dB correction).
   Keep speaker_trim (-24dB) active for protection.

2. Play pink noise at -20dBFS through one speaker channel at a time.

3. Verify SPL at measurement position:
   - Mains: 75-80 dB SPL(A)
   - Subwoofers: 80-85 dB SPL(C) (C-weighting because A attenuates LF)

4. Check UMIK-1 input level:
   - Target: approximately -12 dBFS during pink noise
   - Above -6dBFS: reduce output level
   - Below -24dBFS: increase output level
   - UMIK-1 max SPL is 133dB -- clipping at 80dB is impossible

5. Sweep level = same as pink noise test level (log sweeps have approximately
   the same peak level as pink noise at equal RMS).

6. UMIK-1 calibration file: applied during processing, NOT during capture.
   Raw WAV is saved uncalibrated. Calibration applied mathematically when
   computing frequency response. This preserves raw data.

### 9.3 Room Correction Sweeps (Measure sub-tab, Stage 2)

**Positions:** Cross pattern, 50cm spacing, 3-5 positions:

```
        P2 (50cm forward)
         |
P4 ---- P1 ---- P3
         |
        P5 (50cm back)
```

- P1 = primary listening position (center of dancefloor / mixing position)
- All at ear height: ~165cm standing (PA) or ~112cm seated (home)
- 50cm spacing is approximately one wavelength at 700Hz -- large enough to
  sample different room modes, small enough to stay in one listening zone

**Measurement order:** All speakers from position 1, then move mic, repeat
from position 2, etc. This minimizes mic repositioning (slowest step).

**Count:** 4 speaker channels x 4 positions = 16 sweeps. At ~15s per sweep
(including overhead) = approximately 4 minutes of sweep time plus mic
repositioning.

**Only channels 0-3.** HP and IEM (channels 4-7) are passthrough -- no room
interaction, not measured.

### 9.4 Time Alignment

**Fully automatic from the sweep measurements.** No separate procedure needed.

- Each sweep deconvolution produces an impulse response with a clear onset peak
- Onset time per channel = propagation delay from speaker to mic
- Furthest speaker = reference (delay 0). Others get positive delay
- Uses Position 1 only (primary listening position)
- Accuracy: sample-accurate (20.8 microseconds at 48kHz, approximately 7mm)

### 9.5 Verification Measurement

**Single position (P1) is sufficient.** One sweep per speaker channel with
correction filters active.

**Acceptance criteria:**

| Frequency range | Tolerance |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 30-200 Hz | +/- 3 dB |
| 200-2000 Hz | +/- 2 dB |
| 2000-16000 Hz | +/- 3 dB |
| < 30 Hz, > 16 kHz | Not evaluated |

**STOP condition:** If any channel deviates > 6dB from target at any frequency
(30-16kHz), correction has made things worse. System offers revert to dirac
(passthrough) filters.

**Display:** Gray = uncorrected, colored = corrected, dashed = target curve.
The corrected trace should converge on the target.

## 10. Integration with Existing Web UI

### Backend additions needed

| Endpoint | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `/ws/measure` | WebSocket | Real-time measurement progress, sweep status, processing progress |
| `/api/speakers` | REST | CRUD for speaker identity YAML files |
| `/api/presets` | REST | List, store, recall, delete presets |
| `/api/measure/start` | REST POST | Start measurement pipeline (returns job ID) |
| `/api/measure/abort` | REST POST | Abort running measurement |
| `/api/measure/deploy` | REST POST | Deploy verified filters (with safety interlock) |
| `/api/gain-staging` | REST | Play/stop pink noise for level checks |

### Frontend additions needed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `index.html` | Replace Measure stub div with 5 sub-tab structure |
| `measure.js` | Full implementation: sub-tab switching, stepper, WebSocket handlers |
| `style.css` | Sub-tab styles, stepper styles, chart styles, deploy warning styles |
| New: `speakers.js` | Speaker identity CRUD (could be part of measure.js) |
| New: `charts.js` | Canvas frequency response chart renderer |

### WebSocket message format (proposed)

```json
{
  "type": "measure_progress",
  "stage": 2,
  "stage_name": "measure",
  "position": 2,
  "total_positions": 4,
  "speaker": "main_right",
  "speaker_index": 1,
  "total_speakers": 4,
  "progress": 0.72,
  "elapsed_s": 3.6,
  "total_s": 5.0,
  "status": "measuring"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "measure_result",
  "stage": 7,
  "stage_name": "verify",
  "checks": [
    {"name": "d009_gain_limit", "passed": true, "value": -0.72, "limit": -0.5, "unit": "dB"},
    {"name": "format", "passed": true, "detail": "16384 taps, 48kHz, float32 WAV"},
    {"name": "minimum_phase", "passed": true, "value": 99.2, "unit": "%"},
    {"name": "target_deviation", "passed": true, "value": 2.1, "limit": 3.0, "unit": "dB"},
    {"name": "crossover_sum", "passed": true, "value": 1.8, "limit": 3.0, "unit": "dB"}
  ]
}
```

### CSS design tokens

All designs use existing CSS custom properties from `style.css`:
- `--bg`, `--bg-panel`, `--border` for layout
- `--text`, `--text-dim` for typography
- `--green`, `--yellow`, `--red`, `--blue` for status colors
- Chart-specific colors: raw (red), corrected (green), limit (yellow) --
  already available in the palette

No new design tokens needed.

## 11. Open Questions

1. **Near-field splice frequency:** AE says automatic at ~250Hz. Should this be
   exposed as an advanced setting in the Calibrate UI, or hidden completely?
   **Recommendation:** Hidden. Expose only if users report problems.

2. **Multi-position averaging method:** Arithmetic mean of magnitude responses?
   Complex average? Spatially-weighted? Affects what the Results view shows
   during processing. **Awaiting AE follow-up.**

3. **Calibrate sub-tab detail:** The Calibrate stepper is sketched at high
   level. Full wireframe design deferred until speaker calibration stories are
   written.

4. **Measurement positions on phone:** Should the mic placement guide show a
   diagram on phone? The cross-pattern diagram may be too small. Alternative:
   text-only instructions with distances.

5. **Quick Verify and Time Alignment Only workflows:** These are subsets of the
   full Measure workflow. Should they be separate buttons on the Measure
   sub-tab (e.g., "Full Measurement", "Quick Verify", "Time Align Only"), or
   should the stepper be configurable to skip stages?

## 12. Deferred Work

This document captures the design. Implementation is deferred per backlog
priorities. When ready, the implementation will need:

- Backend: measurement WebSocket handler, speaker CRUD API, preset API,
  pipeline integration (calling `runner.py` stages from FastAPI)
- Frontend: sub-tab navigation, stepper component, Canvas frequency response
  chart, deploy confirmation flow
- Testing: mock measurement data generator (extending the existing scenario
  system), WebSocket message format tests, deploy safety interlock tests
