# Task Register

Tasks are sub-story work items tracked below the story level. Each task belongs
to a parent story or is standalone infrastructure work. This file is the single
source of truth for items that are too granular for a user story but too important
to forget.

**Owner:** Project Manager
**Maintenance rule:** When any lab note, status update, or discussion surfaces a
new item that is not a full story, add it here with a source citation.

## Active Tasks

| ID | Description | Owner | Status | Parent | Source | Notes |
|----|-------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| TK-001 | UMIK-1 timing/sync research: does the USB audio stream provide a timing reference or sync signal? Does it have built-in latency measurement capability? | audio-engineer | done | standalone | user-stories.md:217, :226 (US-002 AC) | **DONE.** UMIK-1 uses adaptive USB clock mode (not asynchronous) — no timing reference. No built-in latency measurement capability. Neither needed: USBStreamer is master clock via PipeWire, and arrival-time detection compensates for constant capture delay. |
| TK-002 | Create CamillaDSP `active.yml` for systemd auto-start | change-manager | done | standalone | US-000 installation TODO #8, status.md line 67 | DONE. Symlink `/etc/camilladsp/active.yml` → `production/live.yml`. Survived reboot. |
| TK-003 | Test gpu_mem=128 for Mixxx (default ~76MB may be insufficient for OpenGL) | unassigned | open | US-006 | CLAUDE.md line 310, US-000 installation TODO #2 | Unblocked: TK-015 done (Mixxx launches). Next: test with gpu_mem=128 in config.txt and verify OpenGL rendering. |
| TK-004 | Decide: measurement pipeline uses REW or pure Python | architect | done | US-008 | CLAUDE.md line 309 | **DONE.** Owner decision (D-016): both. REW for exploratory/ad-hoc work, Python for the automation pipeline. Affects US-008 through US-013. |
| TK-005 | Investigate CamillaDSP websocket API for runtime filter hot-swapping | architect | in-progress | US-008/US-012 | CLAUDE.md line 313-314 | Architect analysis complete: `set_active()` supports coefficient reload with brief audio gap. Acceptable for pre-show workflow. Pending 5-min Pi validation by CM during RustDesk prep. |
| TK-006 | Flight case design: ventilation, cable routing, power distribution | unassigned | open | standalone (D-012) | CLAUDE.md line 317 | D-012 mandates active cooling. Blocks US-003 T4 (thermal test in flight case). Physical hardware task. |
| TK-007 | Disable cloud-init (~3.3s boot overhead) | unassigned | open | US-024 | US-000 installation TODO #7, status.md line 67 | Low priority. Permanent installation, not cloud. |
| TK-008 | Monitor pycamilladsp PyPI for Python 3.13 compatibility | unassigned | open | standalone | US-000 installation TODO #4 | Currently installed from GitHub. Watch for PyPI release. |
| TK-009 | PipeWire vs native JACK latency/stability comparison | unassigned | open | standalone | CLAUDE.md line 312 | Low priority -- PipeWire works. JACK alternative is speculative. |
| TK-010 | Live mode: evaluate whether shorter FIR filters would benefit chunksize 256 | unassigned | open | standalone | CLAUDE.md line 315-316 | Likely wont-do: US-001 proved 16k taps viable at chunksize 256 (19.25% CPU). |
| TK-011 | Install and test REW on Pi 4 ARM | unassigned | open | US-008 | CLAUDE.md line 308 | Java-based, should run on ARM. Useful for ad-hoc verification even if pipeline is pure Python. ~10 min task. |
| TK-012 | Verify CUPS/rpcbind port status | security-specialist | done | US-000a | US-000 installation TODO #5 | **DONE.** rpcbind and CUPS both disabled, not listening. Only SSH (22) exposed. F-011 confirmed resolved. |
| TK-013 | Lab notes T6: correct latency budget (old IEM bypass assumption) | technical-writer | done | US-002 | status.md line 67 | **DONE** (commit `5d46674`). Latency budget corrected for D-011 IEM passthrough. |
| TK-014 | Verify Reaper installation path convention (/home/ela/opt vs /opt) | unassigned | open | standalone | PM observation during US-000b review | Minor -- confirm whether ~/opt is intentional (Pi-Apps default) or should be /opt. |
| TK-015 | Mixxx smoke test: connect via RustDesk, launch Mixxx, verify it renders and plays audio | change-manager | done | US-029 | team-lead directive (UAT gap) | PARTIAL PASS. Launches on stock PREEMPT, 194 MB memory, clean kill. GUI rendering visually confirmed via wayvnc VNC session (2026-03-09). Audio output NOT YET VERIFIED -- pending TK-039. |
| TK-016 | Reaper smoke test: connect via RustDesk, launch Reaper, verify it runs with a project loaded | change-manager | done | US-030 | team-lead directive (UAT gap) | PARTIAL PASS on stock PREEMPT. Launches, 90s alive, clean kill. F-012: crashes on PREEMPT_RT (4x). GUI rendering not visually confirmed. |
| TK-017 | Hercules USB-MIDI functional test: actual DJ control, not just enumeration | unassigned | open | US-005/US-029 | team-lead directive (UAT gap) | US-005 AC covers enumeration. This tests actual MIDI control messages, fader response, button mapping. Prerequisite for US-029 DJ UAT. |
| TK-018 | CamillaDSP stderr logging rule: all future test runs must use `2>/path/to/log` or run under systemd | unassigned | open | standalone | US-003 T3c analysis (lab notes line 527) | Monitoring gap: when CamillaDSP runs under sudo (not systemd), buffer underruns go to stderr only, not journal. Process improvement for all future tests. |
| TK-019 | US-003 T3a (real): DJ mode stability with Mixxx + Hercules (30 min) | unassigned | blocked | US-003 | US-003 AC line 251 | Blocked on: US-005 (Hercules MIDI), US-006 (Mixxx feasibility). TK-015 done (Mixxx launches). AC requires "Mixxx (2 decks, continuous playback)". |
| TK-020 | US-003 T3b (real): Live mode stability with Reaper + vocal input (30 min) | unassigned | blocked | US-003 | US-003 AC line 252 | Blocked on: Reaper project with backing tracks + FX chain (TK-016 done, Reaper launches on stock PREEMPT). AC requires "Reaper (8-track backing + FX)". On stock PREEMPT per D-015. |
| TK-021 | US-003 T3d: Production-config stability retest (8ch, ~34% load) with Reaper | unassigned | blocked | US-003 | US-003 AC line 254 | Blocked on: TK-020. Validates production config under sustained load (vs benchmark 2ch config). |
| TK-022 | F-012: Reaper hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT — investigate and fix | unassigned | open | standalone | TK-016 Test B results, D-015 | **Fix before shipping.** Reaper causes reproducible hard lockup on 6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt within ~1 min of launch. Not OOM, not GPU, not RT priority (`chrt -o 0` also crashes). Needs test rig: serial console + scriptable PSU for kernel oops capture. Proceeding on stock PREEMPT until resolved. |
| TK-023 | Validate chrt -o 0 workaround: Reaper under SCHED_OTHER on PREEMPT_RT | change-manager | done | TK-022 | architect recommendation, D-015 | **FAIL.** Reaper under `chrt -o 0` (SCHED_OTHER) also caused hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Rules out RT priority scheduling as the cause. |
| TK-024 | Script audit: map published test results to version-controlled scripts | quality-engineer | done | standalone | owner request (reproducibility) | **DONE.** US-001: fully traceable (run_benchmarks.sh + gen_configs.py + gen_dirac.py). US-002: fully traceable (measure_latency.py canonical, run_t2a.sh). US-003 T3b/T3c: fully traceable (run-stability-t3b/t3c.sh + monitors). **Gaps:** T3e has no script (ad-hoc), T3e raw data not in repo, T1d/T1e numbers wrong in status.md + user-stories.md (fixed). |
| TK-025 | Dead code cleanup: remove superseded scripts and fix misplacements | quality-engineer | done | standalone | owner request (repo structure), TK-024 findings | **DONE** (`19eac28`). 7 files removed, 1 config moved. Superseded: `test_i2_v2/v3/v4.py`, `test_i2_alsa.py`, `measure_latency_lowlat.py`. Duplicates removed: `scripts/test/stability-monitor.sh`, `scripts/test/xrun-monitor.sh`. Config moved: `test_8ch_loopback.yml` -> `configs/camilladsp/test/`. |
| TK-026 | scripts/ README: index of all scripts with purpose, test mapping, usage | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (repo structure) | **DONE.** `scripts/README.md` created. T1c/T1d/T1e description errors caught and fixed before commit. |
| TK-027 | results/ README: index of result files with test provenance | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (repo structure) | **DONE.** `results/README.md` created. T1e description error caught and fixed (was "8k taps, chunksize 256", corrected to "32k taps, chunksize 2048"). |
| TK-028 | configs/ README: index of test vs production configs | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (repo structure) | **DONE.** `configs/README.md` created. Documents production configs (`dj-pa.yml`, `live.yml`), test configs (T1a-T1e, T2a-T2b, passthrough, stability, loopback), PipeWire and WirePlumber configs. Notes deployment targets. |
| TK-029 | data/ README: index of raw test data with run provenance | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (repo structure) | **DONE.** `data/README.md` created. Documents T3b, T3c, T3e subdirectories with date, kernel, config, script, result status. Notes file sizes and schemas. T3e cyclictest_output.txt (24MB) gitignored. |
| TK-030 | Lab notes: add script/config/result cross-references | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (documentation linkage) | **DONE.** Reproducibility cross-references added to all 4 lab notes (US-001, US-002, US-003, US-028): script, config, and result paths for each test. |
| TK-031 | Repo layout section in top-level README | technical-writer | done | standalone | owner request (documentation linkage) | **DONE.** README repo layout section expanded with `scripts/`, `configs/`, `results/`, `data/`, `docs/` directory descriptions. |
| TK-032 | Write T3e reproducibility script (`scripts/stability/run-stability-t3e.sh`) | unassigned | open | US-003 | TK-024 gap finding | T3e was run with ad-hoc commands (no script). Write a script covering all 5 phases: stock baseline cyclictest, RT kernel install, regression test, validation, deploy. Must match the procedure documented in US-003-T3e-preempt-rt.md lab notes. |
| TK-033 | Copy T3e raw data from Pi to `data/US-003/T3e/` in repo | change-manager | done | US-003 | TK-024 gap finding | **DONE.** Committed as `67a8cb3`. Files: `stability_30min_rt.log` (3.4KB), `cyclictest_rt.txt` (14KB). Full `cyclictest_output.txt` (24MB) gitignored — histogram contains same stats. |
| TK-034 | T1c/T1d/T1e number discrepancy: verify all docs match lab notes | project-manager | done | US-001 | TK-024 gap finding | **DONE.** Lab notes (authoritative): T1c=19.25%, T1d=6.35%, T1e=6.61%. status.md and user-stories.md both had wrong numbers (T1c 20.43%, T1d 5.21%, T1e 10.39%). Fixed in both files. CLAUDE.md does not cite these numbers directly. |
| TK-035 | Install qt6-wayland for native Wayland rendering | change-manager | done | US-006 | owner VNC testing session (2026-03-09) | **DONE.** `qt6-wayland` installed, Mixxx confirmed running native Wayland (no longer XWayland). |
| TK-036 | Fix missing icons in Mixxx | change-manager | in-progress | US-006 | owner VNC testing session (2026-03-09) | Icon theme applied. Pending owner visual confirmation via VNC. |
| TK-037 | Fix Reaper audio device access | unassigned | open | US-030 | owner VNC testing session (2026-03-09) | Reaper cannot open audio device when launched via VNC. Likely needs PipeWire JACK bridge (`pipewire-jack`) installed and configured. Reaper audio settings need to point to JACK, not ALSA directly. |
| TK-038 | Configure fullscreen launch for Mixxx and Reaper | change-manager | in-progress | standalone | owner VNC testing session (2026-03-09) | PARTIAL: apps now maximized but title bar still visible. labwc rule uses `Maximize` -- needs `Fullscreen` or `ToggleDecoration` + `Maximize` to remove the bar. Applies to both Mixxx and Reaper. |
| TK-039 | End-to-end audio validation via VNC | unassigned | blocked | US-029/US-030 | owner VNC testing session (2026-03-09) | Neither Mixxx nor Reaper has confirmed audio output yet. TK-015/TK-016 cannot be FULL PASS until audio is verified. Blocked on: TK-037 (Reaper audio), TK-040 (USBStreamer input visibility), possibly TK-035 (Mixxx audio path). |
| TK-040 | Reaper JACK input: USBStreamer 8ch not visible, only UMIK-1 | unassigned | open | US-030 | owner VNC validation (2026-03-09) | Audio engineer analysis: 3 likely causes in order -- (a) CamillaDSP not running, (b) PipeWire ALSA conflict: `20-usbstreamer.conf` playback node clashes with CamillaDSP exclusive ALSA access (fix: remove playback sink, keep capture only), (c) Reaper not set to JACK backend. Diagnostic: `pw-jack jack_lsp` to check visible ports. |
| TK-041 | 64 phantom MIDI devices in Reaper + unwanted BLE MIDI | unassigned | open | US-030 | owner VNC validation (2026-03-09) | BLE MIDI: NOT Hercules -- likely BlueALSA/bluez artifact despite `disable-bt`. 64 ports: likely `snd-virmidi` module or PipeWire ALSA MIDI bridge over-enumeration (NOT snd-aloop). Key diagnostic: `cat /proc/asound/seq/clients`. Fix: unload `snd-virmidi` or add PipeWire/WirePlumber filter rule. Owner confirmed USB-MIDI works, BT scrapped (PO recording decision). Should be clean before US-030 Live UAT. |

| ID | Description | Owner | Status | Parent | Source | Resolution |
|----|-------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| TK-100 | Verify snd-aloop persists across reboot with index=10 | change-manager | done | US-000 | US-000 installation TODO #1 | DONE in T6. Loopback at card 10 after reboot. |
| TK-101 | Fix USBStreamer 4-channel capture (PipeWire sees only 4ch) | change-manager | done | US-028 | US-000 installation TODO #3 | DONE in T5 + US-028. Explicit PipeWire config with 8 channels. |
| TK-102 | Install RTKit for PipeWire real-time priority | change-manager | done | US-000b | US-000 installation TODO #6 | DONE in US-000b. RTKit installed, PipeWire FIFO rtprio 83-88. |
| TK-103 | PipeWire TS scheduling (running timeshare, not FIFO) | change-manager | done | US-000b | US-001 lab notes line 369, status.md | RESOLVED by US-000b. PipeWire now runs FIFO rtprio 83-88. |
| TK-104 | PipeWire Loopback stereo-only (BLOCKER for production 8ch routing) | change-manager | done | US-028 | US-003 stability tests line 171 | RESOLVED by US-028. Custom PipeWire profile + WirePlumber rules deployed. |
| TK-105 | PREEMPT_RT kernel package availability check | change-manager | done | US-003 | CLAUDE.md line 311 | DONE. `linux-image-6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` available in Trixie repos. Installed in T3e Phase 1-2. |
| TK-106 | Fix CamillaDSP ALSA path (hw:3,0 -> hw:USBStreamer,0) | change-manager | done | US-000b | US-000b lab notes line 434-438 | DONE in US-000b T7. Stable ALSA name prevents USB renumbering failures. |

## Notes

- Tasks TK-001 through TK-041 are active (done in place: TK-001, TK-002, TK-004, TK-012, TK-013, TK-015 (PARTIAL -- audio pending TK-039), TK-016, TK-023 (FAIL), TK-024, TK-025, TK-026, TK-027, TK-028, TK-029, TK-030, TK-031, TK-033, TK-034, TK-035). TK-005/TK-036/TK-038 in-progress. TK-100+ are completed (numbering gap is intentional for clarity).
- TK-024 through TK-034 are the reproducibility/repo-structure audit (owner request). All done except **TK-032** (T3e reproducibility script). TK-024 (QE audit), TK-025 (dead code), TK-026-029 (READMEs), TK-030 (lab notes cross-refs), TK-031 (repo layout), TK-033 (T3e raw data), TK-034 (number fix) -- all complete.
- US-003 T3e complete (PREEMPT_RT installed + validated, 30-min 0 xruns, cyclictest max 209us). F-012 blocks Reaper on RT kernel -- proceeding on stock PREEMPT per D-015.
- UAT stories created by product owner: US-029 (DJ UAT), US-030 (Live UAT), US-031 (Full Rehearsal). TK-015/016/017 are prerequisite smoke tests.
- The "T3b" in lab notes `US-003-stability-tests.md` is synthetic (CamillaDSP + aplay). The real T3b per AC requires Reaper load (TK-020).
- TK-035 through TK-039 are from the owner's VNC testing session (2026-03-09). TK-037 (Reaper audio) blocks TK-039 (end-to-end audio validation), which blocks TK-015/TK-016 FULL PASS.
