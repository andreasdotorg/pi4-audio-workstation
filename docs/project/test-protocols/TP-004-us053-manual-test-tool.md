| Parent story/task | US-053 |
| Author | Quality Engineer |
| Reviewer | UX Specialist (layout), Audio Engineer (SPL accuracy, signal quality), Architect (WebSocket/RPC data flow), AD (safety controls) |
| Status | Draft |

### 1.2 Test Objective

**Feature validation.** This test confirms that the manual test tool page provides
interactive signal generation controls, real-time spectrum visualization, SPL
readout, and safety controls, all communicating with the RT signal generator
(US-052) via RPC through a WebSocket proxy.

**Question answered:** Does the test tool page meet all 13 acceptance criteria
from US-053 and the UX spec at `docs/architecture/test-tool-page.md`?

### 1.3 System Under Test

The test has three phases: Phase A (local scaffold validation, no Pi), Phase B
(local with mock signal gen), and Phase C (Pi hardware with real audio).

**Phase A -- Scaffold Validation (no backend required):**

| Component | Required state | How achieved |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Web UI server | Running in mock mode | `nix run .#local-demo` or `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1 uvicorn` |
| Browser | Chromium (Playwright) or manual | Playwright for automated, manual for visual |
| Git commit | `f3fcfa2` (TT-1) or later | Includes HTML/CSS scaffold |
| US-051 status bar | Committed | Required for persistent frame |

**Phase B -- Local Integration (mock signal gen):**

| Component | Required state | How achieved |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Web UI server | Running in mock mode | `nix run .#local-demo` |
| Signal gen mock | `/ws/siggen` responds to commands | Mock endpoint in FastAPI (when implemented) |
| Browser | Chromium or manual | |
| Git commit | Post-TT-2+ implementation commits | Includes JS logic |

**Phase C -- Pi Hardware:**

| Component | Required state | How achieved |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Git commit | Deployed commit | CM deploys via scp |
| Kernel | `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` | Already running |
| CamillaDSP | Running, FIFO/80 | systemd service |
| PipeWire | Running, FIFO/88 | systemd user service |
| RT signal generator (US-052) | Running, FIFO/70 | systemd service |
| Web UI | Running on port 8080 | systemd service |
| USBStreamer | Connected | Physical |
| UMIK-1 | Available for hot-plug test | Physical USB device |
| Browser | Remote (laptop) | `https://192.168.178.185:8080` |

### 1.4 Dependency Gates

Several US-053 acceptance criteria cannot be fully tested until upstream
dependencies are complete. This table maps each gate.

| Dependency | Status | What it blocks | Fallback |
|------------|--------|---------------|----------|
| US-051 (persistent status bar) | IMPLEMENT (SB-7 Phase B blocked on Pi deploy) | AC-1 (nav integration in persistent frame), emergency stop via ABORT | Phase A: verify nav tab exists; full ABORT test deferred to Phase C |
| US-052 (RT signal generator) | IMPLEMENT (SG-1/3/9 done, Pi integration blocked on TK-151) | AC-5 (RPC commands), AC-6 (SPL readout — needs signal to measure), AC-12 (confirm dialog), AC-13 (emergency stop) | Phase A: verify controls exist, are disabled appropriately; Phase B: mock `/ws/siggen` |
| `/ws/siggen` endpoint | Not yet implemented | AC-5 (RPC), AC-8 (hot-plug via backend), signal state feedback | Phase B: mock endpoint |
| UMIK-1 PCM channel in PcmStreamCollector | Not yet implemented | AC-9 (spectrum of mic input), AC-6/AC-7 (SPL from real mic) | Phase A: verify source selector exists; spectrum on main L+R channels works |

### 1.5 Controlled Variables

| Variable | Controlled value | Control mechanism | What happens if it drifts |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Mock mode (Phase A/B) | `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1` | Environment variable | Tests get no data -- visually obvious |
| Viewport width | 1280px, 600px, 400px | Playwright `set_viewport_size` or browser devtools | Responsive tests invalid |
| Signal gen availability | Mock (Phase B), Real (Phase C) | Deployed service | Controls grayed out, error state tested |
| UMIK-1 presence | Present/absent | Physical USB plug/unplug (Phase C) | Hot-plug test not possible |

### 1.6 Pass/Fail Criteria

**Note on AC-4 vs UX spec:** The AC lists "silence" as a signal type, but the
UX spec (Section 3.1) lists Sine/White/Pink/Sweep with no explicit Silence
button. Sending a `stop` command is functionally equivalent to silence. Flag for
PO clarification if Silence button is required as a 5th signal type.

### 1.7 Execution Procedure

#### Phase A: Scaffold Validation (No Backend Required for Static Checks)

**Step 1: Static code checks (S4, S5, S6, AC-6.5, AC-11.1, D2.1)**

These are static checks against committed code. No running server needed.

```
Grep style.css for test tool rules without tt- prefix          -> expect 0 matches (S4)
Check test.js for PiAudio.registerView("test", ...)            -> expect present (S5)
Count .tt-channel-btn[data-ch] in index.html                   -> expect 8 (S6)
Check test.js for AudioContext/Web Audio API                   -> expect 0 matches (AC-6.5)
Check test.js for JACK/PipeWire client code                    -> expect 0 (AC-11.1)
Check docs/architecture/test-tool-page.md exists               -> expect yes (D2.1)
```

**Step 2: Start mock server**

```bash
nix run .#local-demo
# or: cd src/web-ui && PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1 uvicorn app.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Step 3: Navigation tests (AC-1: 1.1-1.4)**

Open `http://localhost:8080`. Verify Test tab is present, clickable, shows
`#view-test`, and status bar frame is present.

**Step 4: Scaffold structure tests (S1-S3, R1-R4)**

Set viewport to 1280px: verify two-column layout.
Set viewport to 500px: verify stacked layout.
Measure spectrum container height.
Check touch target sizes.

**Step 5: Control element existence (AC-2.1-2.3, AC-3.1-3.3, AC-4.1, AC-5.1-5.2, AC-5.7, AC-7.1-7.3, AC-10.1-10.2)**

Verify all expected DOM elements exist with correct attributes and default values.

**Step 6: Signal type defaults (AC-4.5-4.6)**

Check frequency slider attributes and default value.

#### Phase B: Local Integration (Mock Signal Gen Required)

**Prerequisite:** `/ws/siggen` mock endpoint implemented in FastAPI backend.

**Step 7: Signal type toggle behavior (AC-4.2-4.4)**

Click each signal type button. Verify mutual exclusion and frequency section
visibility toggling.

**Step 8: Channel selection behavior (AC-3.4-3.6)**

Test single-select default. Test MULTI mode. Verify sub channel orange styling.

**Step 9: PLAY/STOP button behavior (AC-5.3-5.4, AC-5.9-5.10)**

Verify PLAY disabled with no channel. Select channel, verify PLAY enabled.
Press PLAY, verify state transition. Press STOP, verify signal stops.

**Step 10: RPC command verification (AC-6.1-6.4)**

Monitor `/ws/siggen` messages during control interactions. Verify correct
command format per UX spec Section 6.1.

**Step 11: Level slider behavior (AC-2.4, AC-2.6)**

Move slider, verify readout updates. Move above -6 dBFS, verify visual warning.

**Step 12: Duration controls (AC-5.7-5.8)**

Toggle Continuous/Burst. Verify burst input enables/disables. Change burst
duration value.

**Step 13: Pre-action warning (AC-12.1-12.3)**

Press PLAY first time: verify dialog. Confirm, stop, play again: verify no
dialog on second play.

**Step 14: Error state -- signal gen unavailable (E1-E2)**

Load page without signal gen mock. Verify controls grayed out, spectrum still
functional.

**Step 15: Confirmed state feedback (E5)**

Press PLAY. Verify button stays IDLE until mock signal gen confirms PLAYING.

#### Phase C: Pi Hardware Validation (When US-052 Deployed)

**Prerequisites:** CM deploys latest code to Pi. CamillaDSP, PipeWire, RT signal
generator, web UI all running. USBStreamer connected. UMIK-1 available.

**Step 16: Integration test (D3.1-D3.3)**

Select channel, set level, play 1 kHz sine. Verify:
- Signal audible from correct speaker
- SPL readout shows values
- Spectrum shows 1 kHz peak

**Step 17: Hard cap verification (AC-2.5, D5.1)**

Set slider to 0 dBFS. Play signal. Verify CamillaDSP levels show output capped
at -0.5 dBFS.

**Step 18: Continuous and burst modes (AC-5.5-5.6)**

Test continuous mode (10s duration). Test burst mode (5s auto-stop).

**Step 19: SPL update rate (AC-7.4)**

Play pink noise. Time SPL readout updates. Verify >= 4 Hz.

**Step 20: Spectrum update rate (AC-10.3)**

Play signal. Observe spectrum animation rate. Verify >= 4 Hz.

**Step 21: UMIK-1 hot-plug (AC-9.1-9.3)**

1. Start with UMIK-1 disconnected. Verify "not connected" state.
2. Plug in UMIK-1. Verify SPL activates, spectrum shows mic input, no reload.
3. Unplug UMIK-1. Verify graceful degradation.
4. Replug UMIK-1. Verify automatic recovery.

**Step 22: Emergency stop (AC-13.2-13.4)**

While signal playing:
1. Verify ABORT visible in status bar
2. Press STOP -- verify immediate silence
3. Start again, press ABORT in status bar -- verify immediate silence

**Step 23: CamillaDSP-not-running warning (E3)**

Stop CamillaDSP. Verify warning banner appears on test tool page.

**Step 24: Cross-reference mini meters (UX spec Section 8.2)**

Play test signal on channel 3. Verify:
- Sub1 mini meter in status bar shows activity
- Dashboard full meters show same (if Dashboard visible)

**Step 25: Signal quality and SPL accuracy (D6.1-D6.2)**

Play 1 kHz sine. Check spectrum for THD.
Play pink noise. Compare Pi SPL with REW reading.

### 1.9 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| US-052 not ready for Phase C | HIGH (SG tasks in progress, Pi integration blocked on TK-151) | Cannot test AC-5 through AC-6, AC-12, AC-13 runtime behavior | Phase B mock validates command flow; Phase C deferred |
| US-051 not deployed to Pi | MEDIUM (SB-7 Phase B blocked) | Cannot test AC-1.4 (status bar frame on Pi) | Phase A validates locally |
| Nix blocked on macOS (SQLite cache) | HIGH (currently happening) | Cannot run `nix run .#local-demo` locally | Use `nix develop` shell or defer to Pi |
| UMIK-1 PCM channel not in PcmStreamCollector | HIGH (not yet implemented) | Cannot test spectrum with UMIK-1 source | Test with Main L+R source; UMIK-1 source deferred |
| `/ws/siggen` endpoint not yet implemented | HIGH (new endpoint) | Cannot test any RPC communication | Phase B blocked until endpoint exists; Phase A tests structure only |

### 1.10 Approval
