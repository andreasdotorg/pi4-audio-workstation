# Test Protocol: US-051 Persistent Status Bar

## Part 1: Test Protocol (Before Execution)

### 1.1 Identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Protocol ID | TP-003 |
| Title | US-051 Persistent Status Bar Validation |
| Parent story/task | US-051 (subsumes TK-225, TK-226, TK-227) |
| Author | Quality Engineer |
| Reviewer | UX Specialist (layout), Audio Engineer (meter accuracy), Architect (data flow) |
| Status | Draft |

### 1.2 Test Objective

**Feature validation.** This test confirms that the persistent status bar (health
indicators, 24 mini level meters, ABORT button) renders correctly on all web UI
tabs, receives data independently of per-view WebSocket connections, and causes
no regressions in existing Dashboard functionality.

**Question answered:** Does the status bar meet all 11 acceptance criteria from
US-051 and the UX spec at `docs/architecture/persistent-status-bar.md`?

### 1.3 System Under Test

The test has two phases: Phase A (local, no Pi) and Phase B (Pi hardware).

**Phase A — Local (mock mode):**

| Component | Required state | How achieved |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Web UI server | Running in mock mode | `nix run .#local-demo` or `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1 uvicorn` |
| Browser | Chromium (Playwright) or manual | Playwright for automated, manual for visual |
| Git commit | `0035320` or later | Includes SB-1 through SB-7a + e2e fix |

**Phase B — Pi hardware:**

| Component | Required state | How achieved |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Git commit | Deployed commit | CM deploys via scp |
| Kernel | `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` | Already running |
| CamillaDSP | Running, FIFO/80 | systemd service |
| PipeWire | Running, FIFO/88 | systemd user service |
| Web UI | Running on port 8080 | systemd service |
| USBStreamer | Connected | Physical |
| Browser | Remote (laptop) | `https://192.168.178.185:8080` |

### 1.4 Controlled Variables

| Variable | Controlled value | Control mechanism | What happens if it drifts |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Mock mode (Phase A) | `PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1` | Environment variable | Tests get no data — visually obvious |
| Viewport width | 1280px, 600px, 400px | Playwright `set_viewport_size` or browser devtools | Responsive tests invalid |
| WebSocket endpoints | `/ws/monitoring`, `/ws/system` | Existing backend | Status bar shows "--" — test fails |

### 1.5 Pass/Fail Criteria

Organized by AC from `user-stories.md` lines 2731-2748.

---

#### AC-8: WebSocket connection independent of per-view connections

| # | Criterion | Measurement method | Pass condition | Fail condition | Justification |
|---|-----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 8.1 | Status bar receives data on non-Dashboard tabs | Navigate to Measure tab; observe status bar updates | Health indicators continue updating (temp, CPU change over time) | Values freeze at last Dashboard state | AC: "connects on page load, persists across tab switches" |
| 8.2 | Global consumer registration | Code review: `statusbar.js` calls `PiAudio.registerGlobalConsumer` | Registration call present, `dispatchToGlobalConsumers` dispatches to all registered consumers regardless of active view | Status bar only receives data on Dashboard tab | AC: "independent of per-view connections" |
| 8.3 | Tab switch does not disconnect/reconnect WebSocket | Monitor browser devtools Network tab during tab switches | No WebSocket close/reopen events when switching tabs | WebSocket disconnects and reconnects on each tab switch | UX spec Section 5.2: "unlike views... the status bar is always active" |

| # | Criterion | Measurement method | Pass condition | Fail condition | Justification |
|---|-----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 9.1 | No new backend endpoints | Code review: `app/server.py` and `app/collectors/` | No new WebSocket endpoints or REST endpoints added for status bar | New endpoint exists | AC: "no new backend collectors needed" |
| 9.2 | Status bar consumes `/ws/monitoring` and `/ws/system` | Code review: `statusbar.js` `onMonitoring` and `onSystem` callbacks | Callbacks process data from existing endpoints | Status bar creates its own WebSocket connection to a new path | UX spec Section 5.1 |

---

#### AC-10: Pixel budget validated at 1280px minimum viewport width

| # | Criterion | Measurement method | Pass condition | Fail condition | Justification |
|---|-----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|

| A4 | ABORT from non-Measure tab stops measurement (Phase B) | Click ABORT on Dashboard tab during active measurement | Measurement aborts, CamillaDSP restored, ABORT hides | Measurement continues or error | UX spec Section 3.4 steps 1-5 |

---

### 1.6 Execution Procedure

#### Phase A: Local Validation (No Pi Required)

**Step 1: Code review checks (M1-M4, AC-9, AC-11)**

These are static checks against the committed code. No running server needed.

```
Grep static/js/ for: mw-abort-btn, nav-temp, mode-badge  -> expect 0 matches (M1)
Grep index.html for: mw-abort-btn, nav-temp, mode-badge   -> expect 0 matches (M2)
Cross-reference data-testid in test_measurement_wizard.py vs index.html (M3)
Count [data-testid="abort-measurement"] in index.html      -> expect exactly 1 (M4)
Check app/server.py for new endpoints                       -> expect none (AC-9.1)
Check statusbar.js for registerGlobalConsumer call           -> expect present (AC-9.2)
Check docs/architecture/persistent-status-bar.md exists      -> expect yes (AC-11.1)
```

**Step 2: Start mock server**

```bash
nix run .#local-demo
# or: cd src/web-ui && PI_AUDIO_MOCK=1 uvicorn app.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

**Step 3: Tab presence tests (AC-1: 1.1-1.6)**

Open `http://localhost:8080` in browser. For each of the 5 tabs (Dashboard,
System, Measure, Test, MIDI):
1. Click the tab
2. Verify `#status-bar` is visible (not hidden, not zero-height)
3. Verify status bar position has not moved

**Step 4: Health indicator tests (AC-2: 2.1-2.6)**

On any tab, verify:
- `#sb-dsp-state` shows a value (not empty)
- `#sb-quantum` shows a numeric value
- `#sb-clip` shows a numeric value
- `#sb-xruns` shows a numeric value
- `#sb-temp` shows a value with "C"
- `#sb-cpu` shows a value with "%"

**Step 5: Buffer display test (AC-3: 3.1)**

Navigate to Dashboard. Inspect `#hb-dsp-buffer`. Verify it shows a percentage
or utilization indicator, not a raw sample count like "8189".

**Step 6: Label clarity test (AC-4: 4.1)**

Verify status bar has "DSP:" label for DSP state and that CPU percentage is
visually distinct (not labeled "DSP" or confused with DSP load).

**Step 7: Mini meter structure tests (AC-5: 5.1-5.3)**

Inspect DOM for 4 canvas elements. Verify dimensions match UX spec. Verify
color coding by visual inspection or canvas pixel sampling.

**Step 8: Mini meter animation test (AC-6: 6.1)**

With mock server running, verify at least some mini meter bars show non-zero
fill (mock data should produce varying levels).

**Step 9: PHYS IN graceful degradation test (AC-7: 7.1)**

Verify `#sb-mini-physin` canvas renders without errors. Since TK-096 is not
implemented, PHYS IN meters should show empty/zero bars with no JS errors in
browser console.

**Step 10: WebSocket independence test (AC-8: 8.1-8.3)**

1. Open browser devtools Network tab, filter for WebSocket
2. Navigate to Dashboard — note WebSocket connections
3. Navigate to Measure tab — verify no WebSocket close/reopen
4. Verify status bar health indicators continue updating on Measure tab

**Step 11: Responsive tests (AC-10: 10.1-10.3)**

Using browser devtools or Playwright `set_viewport_size`:
1. 1280x720: verify full layout, no overflow
2. 600x900: verify center zone compression, ABORT button sizing, meter groups hidden per spec
3. 400x900: verify ultra-compact, only 6 meters visible

**Step 12: Dashboard regression tests (DoD-3: D3.1-D3.4)**

Navigate to Dashboard. Verify:
- Health bar still visible and populated
- Full 24-channel meters render
- Spectrum canvas visible
- No JS errors in console

**Step 13: ABORT idle state test (A1)**

With no measurement active, verify `#sb-abort-btn` has class "hidden".

**Step 14: Playwright browser integration tests (D3.4)**

```bash
nix run .#test-integration-browser
```

If Nix is blocked, perform code review verification (already done for the 3
abort tests in `0035320` review).

#### Phase B: Pi Hardware Validation (When Deployment Available)

**Prerequisites:** CM deploys latest code to Pi. CamillaDSP, PipeWire, web UI
all running. Audio flowing through the system.

**Step 15: Real-data health indicators (AC-2 on Pi)**

Navigate to `https://192.168.178.185:8080`. Verify health indicators show real
values matching the Pi state (cross-reference with SSH: `cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`, `top`, etc.).

**Step 16: Real-data mini meters (AC-6: 6.2)**

With audio playing through Mixxx or Reaper:
- Verify mini meter bars in DSP>OUT group animate
- Compare activity pattern with full Dashboard meters
- Verify MAIN group shows capture activity if mic is connected

**Step 17: Clip detection (AC-6: 6.3)**

If safely achievable (PA off, headphones only): send a signal near 0 dBFS to
one channel. Verify the corresponding mini meter bar flashes red.

**Step 18: ABORT during measurement (A2-A4)**

Start a measurement session:
1. Verify ABORT button becomes visible (A2)
2. Navigate to Dashboard tab — verify ABORT still visible (A3)
3. Click ABORT on Dashboard tab — verify measurement stops (A4)
4. Verify CamillaDSP restored to production config

**Step 19: Cross-tab meter accuracy (Phase B only)**

With audio flowing, rapidly switch between all 5 tabs. Verify:
- Mini meters never freeze
- Mini meters never show stale data (channels that were active but are now silent should decay)
- No JS errors in console

## Part 2: Test Execution Record

### Phase A — Code Review Results (Steps 1, 14)

Executed by QE during session 2026-03-15 against commit `0035320`.

**M1: No stale JS references to removed elements**
```
grep mw-abort-btn static/js/ → 0 matches  PASS
grep nav-temp static/js/     → 0 matches  PASS
grep mode-badge static/js/   → 0 matches  PASS
```

**M2: No stale HTML references to removed elements**
```
grep mw-abort-btn index.html → 0 matches  PASS
grep nav-temp index.html     → 0 matches  PASS
grep mode-badge index.html   → 0 matches  PASS
```

**M3: All e2e data-testid selectors resolve**

| Selector | Test file lines | HTML line | Element | Status |
|----------|----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| `start-measurement` | 54, 94, 111, 123, 149, 180, 216, 248, 346, 362 | 360 | `#mw-start-btn` | PASS |
| `measurement-state` | 63, 103, 233, 331 | 336 | `#mw-state-text` | PASS |
| `abort-measurement` | 72, 114, 251 | 75 | `#sb-abort-btn` | PASS (fixed in `0035320`) |
| `progress-pre` | 131 | 339 | `#mw-progress-pre` | PASS |
| `progress-sweep` | 132 | 342 | `#mw-progress-sweep` | PASS |
| `progress-post` | 133 | 345 | `#mw-progress-post` | PASS |
| `gain-cal-level` | 161 | 402 | `.mw-level-bar` | PASS |
| `sweep-progress` | 201 | 453 | `.mw-progress-track` | PASS |

**8/8 selectors present. PASS.**

**M4: Exactly one ABORT button with data-testid**
```
grep 'data-testid="abort-measurement"' index.html → 1 match (line 75)  PASS
```

**AC-9.1: No new backend endpoints**
No new WebSocket or REST endpoints added to `app/server.py` or `app/collectors/`
for the status bar. Status bar consumes existing `/ws/monitoring` and `/ws/system`.
PASS.

**AC-9.2: Global consumer registration**
`statusbar.js` calls `PiAudio.registerGlobalConsumer("statusbar", {...})` with
`onMonitoring`, `onSystem`, and `onMeasurement` callbacks. `app.js` dispatches
to all global consumers via `dispatchToGlobalConsumers()`. PASS.

**AC-11.1: UX spec exists**
`docs/architecture/persistent-status-bar.md` exists, 14 sections, 805 lines.
PASS.

**AC-8.2: Global consumer architecture (code review)**
`app.js` maintains `globalConsumers` registry (line 26). `dispatchToGlobalConsumers`
(line 48) iterates all registered consumers and invokes the appropriate callback
based on WebSocket path mapping (`WS_PATH_TO_CALLBACK`, line 31). This runs
independently of `activeView`. PASS.

### Phase A — Runtime Tests (Steps 2-13)

**Status:** BLOCKED. Nix commands fail (SQLite cache permission). System Python
lacks numpy (required by measurement session import chain). Cannot start mock
server locally. Deferred to Pi deployment (Phase B) or Nix environment fix.

### Phase B — Pi Hardware Validation (Steps 15-19)

**Status:** BLOCKED. Awaiting CM deployment to Pi.

---

### 2.7 Outcome (Partial)

**Phase A Code Review: PASS** (12/12 code review checks pass)
**Phase A Runtime: BLOCKED** (Nix/numpy environment issue)
**Phase B: BLOCKED** (awaiting Pi deployment)

**Overall: PARTIAL — code review PASS, runtime and hardware validation pending.**
