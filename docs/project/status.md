# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing, CamillaDSP for
real-time signal processing, Mixxx for DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal
performance. The system is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for
headless operation, and benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap
FIR convolution on four channels comes in at 5% in DJ mode and about 34% in
live mode with the full 8-channel production configuration -- far below the
limits that would have forced compromises on filter quality. The bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist targets approximately
21 milliseconds at D-011 parameters -- within the threshold where a singer can
perform comfortably.

The next phase is the automated room correction pipeline: the software that
measures each venue, computes correction filters, and deploys them. Everything
validated so far -- the filter design, the CPU budget, the latency model --
feeds into that pipeline. The foundation is solid; the interesting work is
ahead.

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation complete.** US-001 (CPU) and US-002 (latency) both done. US-003 (stability tests) in progress, US-004 (assumption register) selected. D-011: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256. IEM through CamillaDSP passthrough confirmed as net benefit.

## In Progress

- **US-003** (in-progress): Stability and thermal tests with D-011 parameters (chunksize 256, quantum 256). Audio engineer proposed T3c stretch goal: quantum 128 stability test (30 min, zero xruns).
- **US-004** (selected): Assumption register — independent, can run in parallel with US-003.
- **US-000a** (in-review): 4/4 DoD — F-002 and F-011 both resolved, verified across reboot
- **Completed this session:** US-000, US-000b, US-001 (16k taps both modes), US-002 (CamillaDSP = 2 chunks latency, D-011 confirmed)
- **Remaining TODOs**: cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (US-024 candidate), CamillaDSP needs `active.yml` before service enable, PipeWire TS scheduling issue, lab notes T6 latency budget minor correction (old IEM bypass assumption)
