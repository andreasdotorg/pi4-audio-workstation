# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing, CamillaDSP for
real-time signal processing, Mixxx for DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal
performance. The system is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for
headless operation, and benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap
FIR convolution on four channels comes in at 5% in DJ mode and about 34% in
live mode with the full 8-channel production configuration -- far below the
limits that would have forced compromises on filter quality. The bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist targets approximately
21 milliseconds at D-011 parameters -- within the threshold where a singer can
perform comfortably.

The next phase is the automated room correction pipeline: the software that
measures each venue, computes correction filters, and deploys them. Everything
validated so far -- the filter design, the CPU budget, the latency model --
feeds into that pipeline. The foundation is solid; the interesting work is
ahead.

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation complete.** US-001 (CPU) and US-002 (latency) both done. US-003 (stability tests) in progress, US-004 (assumption register) selected. D-011: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256. IEM through CamillaDSP passthrough confirmed as net benefit.

## In Progress

- **US-003** (in-progress): T3b PASS, T3c informational, T3e PASS (PREEMPT_RT 30min stability). T3a (DJ stability with Mixxx) and T4 (thermal in flight case) remaining — T3a blocked on US-005 (Hercules MIDI) and US-006 (Mixxx feasibility). TK-015 done (Mixxx launches). T3b-real (TK-020) blocked on Reaper project setup.
- **F-012** (open): Reaper hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT. `chrt -o 0` workaround failed (TK-023 FAIL). Proceeding on stock PREEMPT per D-015. Fix before shipping.
- **F-013** (resolved): wayvnc password auth added (TK-047 done). RustDesk removed (TK-048 done). F-014 also resolved.
- **US-004** (in-review): Assumption register written (A1-A26), accuracy corrections committed (`0720f94`). Gap: A27 in AC not yet in register. Pending: DoD sign-off.
- **US-000a** (in-review): 4/4 DoD — F-002 and F-011 both resolved, verified across reboot
- **Completed this session:** US-000, US-000b, US-001 (16k taps both modes), US-002 (D-011 confirmed), T3e Phases 1-3 (PREEMPT_RT installed + validated), TK-002 (active.yml symlink)
- **Remaining TODOs**: cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (TK-007), F-012 Reaper RT lockup (TK-022)

## Blockers

- **F-012: Reaper hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT.** Reaper causes a reproducible hard kernel lockup on `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` within ~1 minute of launch (4 crashes total: 3 on RT incl. `chrt -o 0`, 1 PASS on stock PREEMPT). Not OOM, not GPU, not RT priority (`chrt -o 0` also crashes). D-015: continue on stock PREEMPT, fix before shipping. Needs test rig (serial console + scriptable PSU) for kernel oops capture. Blocks: D-013 full compliance, TK-020/TK-021 on RT kernel.
- **F-013: RESOLVED.** wayvnc password auth added (TK-047), RustDesk purged (TK-048), firewall rules cleaned. No longer blocks TK-039.
- **F-014: RESOLVED.** RustDesk UDP 21116-21119 firewall rules removed as part of TK-048.
