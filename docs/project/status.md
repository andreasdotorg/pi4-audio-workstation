# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing and real-time
FIR convolution (via its built-in filter-chain convolver, D-040), Mixxx for
DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal performance. CamillaDSP was the original
DSP engine but was abandoned (D-040) after benchmarking showed PipeWire's
convolver is 3-5.6x more CPU-efficient (FFTW3/NEON vs rustfft). The system
is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for headless operation, and
benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap FIR convolution on
four channels comes in at 1.70% in DJ mode (quantum 1024) and 3.47% in live
mode (quantum 256) -- far below the limits that would have forced compromises
on filter quality. The PA path latency for the vocalist is approximately
5.3ms at quantum 256 (live mode) -- well within the threshold where a singer
can perform comfortably without slapback perception.

The automated room correction pipeline (TK-071) is written: 13 DSP modules
covering sweep generation, deconvolution, correction filter computation,
crossover integration, spatial averaging, and D-009-compliant verification.
Bose speaker profiles are measured and crossover filters generated. The next
phase is on-site measurement with real speakers and UMIK-1, plus the remaining
stability tests (T3d, T4) and DJ controller integration (US-005/US-006).

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation nearly complete. DJ mode gig-ready. Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15): build observable, controllable tools before further automation.** US-001 (CPU), US-002 (latency), US-005 (Hercules MIDI), US-006 (Mixxx feasibility) all done. US-003 (stability): T3a PASS (owner approved 2026-03-12), T3b/T3c/T3e done, T3d unblocked (pending Reaper end-to-end), T4 requires physical hardware. US-029 (DJ UAT) now unblocked. D-011 confirmed: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022: upstream V3D fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`). PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL for all modes. Room correction pipeline done (TK-071). Web UI dashboard deployed with real data, HTTPS, spectrum analyzer (D-020 Stage 1+2, D-032). F-030: web UI monitor causes xruns under DJ load (workaround: stop service). Bose speaker profiles measured (PS28 III sub, Jewel Double Cube satellite). Reaper upgraded to 7.64. Speaker driver database (Tier 5, US-039-043) in progress. **D-036 measurement daemon: TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE, then PAUSED.** 6 reviewers all APPROVED. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `81a7d26`. TK-202 paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. TK-224 and TK-229 also paused/superseded. **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** (1) Dedicated Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled, replaces Python `sd.playrec()`). (2) Persistent status bar with mini meters in all views (TK-225/226 promoted to essential). (3) Manual test tool page in web UI. (4) Spectrum visualization of mic signal. Gating step: TK-151 (pcm-bridge) Pi deployment validates Rust-on-Pi build chain (AD-F006). **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct — perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error. **Safety incident TK-228:** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy. 4 lessons learned (L-018 through L-021). **Three parallel workstreams:** (1) TK-151 Pi validation (gates RT signal gen), (2) TK-225/226 status bar (no dependencies), (3) architect RT signal gen design.

## In Progress

- **TK-202** (PAUSED): All 6 reviewers APPROVED. Paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. Deployment resumes after RT signal gen operational. Review results preserved.
- **TK-224** (PAUSED, was HIGH deployment blocker): Root cause (per-burst stream opening / WirePlumber routing race) will be addressed by RT signal generator. Previous fixes retained (cosine taper, pre-gen noise, reverts).
- **TK-151** (**DONE — S-001 Steps 3-9 ALL PASS**): pcm-bridge runtime validated on Pi. AD-F006 build chain + runtime both proven. **TK-236 VERIFIED (HIGH).** 8 AUX output ports created and linked to loopback-8ch-sink on Pi (build #8, commit `5f353ed`). Fix: `audio.position` property in stream props + SPA format pod. Playback: AUX0-AUX7 (8 output ports matching loopback sink). Capture: MONO. 10 regression tests. pcm-bridge capture mode may need same fix (future item).
- **US-056** (CANCELLED — D-040 2026-03-16): CamillaDSP abandoned. JACK backend migration no longer needed.
- **US-057** (CANCELLED — D-040 2026-03-16): CamillaDSP abandoned. PW-native investigation no longer relevant.
- **US-058** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-16): PW filter-chain FIR benchmark. BM2-4 PASS: 1.70% q1024, 3.47% q256. Triggered D-040.
- **US-059** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-21): GraphManager Core + Production Filter-Chain (Phase A). **DoD: 14/14 — ALL ITEMS SATISFIED.** Clean reboot demo PASS (CHANGE session S-004, worker-1, 17/17 checks green). QE approved DEPLOY/VERIFY fast-track: accumulated deployment evidence (GM-12 40min DJ session, C-006 config deployment, D-001 6-iteration reboot test, O-018 13h39m soak, S-001/S-002 VERIFY sessions) exceeds single-session VERIFY requirements. System running in production since 2026-03-20 with zero steady-state xruns. GM tasks: 14/15 (GM-8 CamillaDSP removal tracked separately). HEAD: `5fbd5f7`. WP stays per D-043 (owner defers reconsideration). **Tracked follow-ups:** F-033 (Reaper JACK bridge RT), I-1 CI wiring, spectral verification (AC line 3141), D-042 lifting (q256 stability).
- **US-062** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-20): Boot-to-DJ Mode (minimum viable auto-launch). **DoD: 7/7 — ALL ITEMS SATISFIED.** #1 q1024 static config (D-042), #2 Mult persistence verified (C-009), #3 Mixxx systemd service (`0df1e56`), #4 DJ routing script + service (`0df1e56`+`ff40766`), #5 reboot test PASS (D-001: 6 iterations, 12 links, zero bypass, q1024, ERR=0), #6 safety review SAFE (architect), #7 owner accepted (sound playing, levels OK). D-001 deployment findings: CamillaDSP system service disabled, WirePlumber unmasked with auto-link suppression (D-039 amendment needed), Mixxx JACK bypass cleanup handled by routing script.
- **O-018 overnight soak** (2026-03-21): 13h 39m uptime, **zero xruns** after 7-min startup settling. 66.7C, 0x0 throttle, 1.0 GiB memory, zero swap. All services healthy. Strong pre-deployment baseline for GM deployment. Validates US-062 boot-to-DJ stability over extended unattended operation.
- **D-002 DEPLOY + VERIFY sessions** (**CLOSED** — 2026-03-21): US-052/US-060/US-061 deployed and verified. **S-001:** US-052 PASS (F-034/F-035 workarounds), US-060/US-061 BLOCKED (production path gap). **S-002:** US-060 PASS (redeployed to `~/web-ui/`), US-061 PASS (redeployed to `~/room-correction/`).

- **US-052** (Phase: **VERIFY, DoD 4/6** — S-001 PASS 2026-03-21): RT Signal Generator. Running on Pi, responds to RPC. F-034/F-035 repo fixes committed (`33b5577`). SG-13 deferred (graceful startup). US-053 unblocked.
- **US-060** (Phase: **VERIFY, DoD 3/7** — S-002 PASS 2026-03-21): PipeWire Monitoring Replacement (Phase B). FilterChainCollector running, GM RPC working, 0 xruns. `56ef3f0` LevelsCollector adds PW-native level data. Known gaps: AC #3 processing load (F-039, needs US-063 pw-top parsing), AC #7 xrun counter (needs US-063 PW metadata).
- **US-061** (Phase: **VERIFY, DoD 1/8** — S-002 PASS 2026-03-21): Measurement Pipeline Adaptation (Phase C). Client files deployed, imports OK on Pi. Known gaps resolved: deploy.py path fixed (`3dcccc2`), measure_nearfield.py pycamilladsp removed (`d368c76`).
- **US-050** (Phase: **TEST, DoD 6/6** — advanced 2026-03-21): Measurement Pipeline Mock Backend.

T-050-1/2: worker evidence from implementation may suffice. Stale AC (line 2718 "Real CamillaDSP") flagged as doc cleanup. CM committing code.
- **US-051** (Phase: **TEST, DoD 4/4** — advanced 2026-03-21): Persistent System Status Bar. QE test plan delivered: T-051-1 (Playwright E2E, 20+ tests in `test_status_bar.py`), T-051-2 (CI regression), T-051-3 (D-040 inspection — QE reviewing), T-051-4 (Pi hardware — deferred to VERIFY per QE recommendation). TP-003 protocol exists. Committed `8975b5b`. T-051-1/2 need worker execution.
- **US-053** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT, DoD 4/6** — code complete 2026-03-21): Manual Test Tool Page. Code committed (`94103c3`): 7 UX spec fixes, signal-gen env var. Remaining DoD: #3 integration test (Pi), #4 hot-plug test (Pi), #5 AD sign-off (safety controls), #6 AE sign-off (signal quality). All remaining items need Pi access.
- **US-065** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT, DoD 6/10** — committed `965f501` + `5dad57e` + `30a25e1`): Configuration Tab. Code + E2E test + F-046 quantum confirm dialog all committed. Remaining DoD: UX screenshot gate (#7), Pi integration test (#8), architect sign-off (#9), safety review (#10).
- **US-064** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT, DoD 1/8** — rework in progress, F-059): PW Graph Visualization Tab. Phase 1 committed (`e72de9b`): SPA config parser, 38 tests. Phase 2+ not started — no worker assigned. Remaining: pw-dump graph builder, dynamic SVG layout, live updates, E2E tests, architect review, UX review.
- **US-070** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — committed `6db6f28`): CI Setup. Workflow YAML + runner setup script + `test-everything` flake target all committed. Enables branch-based parallel work (resolves L-039). DoD TBD — needs PO acceptance criteria. **Runner one-time setup not yet done (owner manual action).**
- **US-066** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — T-066-1/2/3 committed): Spectrum and Meter Polish. Phase 1 committed: F-026 spectrum clock drift fix (`784c408`), T-066-2 D-040 label updates (`a473c12`), T-066-3 PHYS IN inactive state (`c021fca`). Phase 2: pcm-bridge deployment + TK-112 validation needs Pi CHANGE session. **STALLED** — needs Pi.
- **US-044** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — T-044-1 through T-044-5 + T-044-8 committed): Safety protection suite (rewritten for D-040). T-044-4 watchdog (`7600280`), T-044-1 ALSA lockout (`df70fc5`), T-044-2 WP hardening (`1cb8834`), T-044-3+5 link audit + gain integrity (`6bde490`), T-044-8 safety docs (`bcab1fd`). **Remaining:** T-044-6 reboot survival, T-044-7 no-interference — both need Pi.
- **F-049** (RESOLVED, pending commit): Measurement wizard mock session state isolation fixed (task #24).
- **F-050** (**RESOLVED** — `1b527d8` 2026-03-22): Dashboard brightness increased for spectrum grid lines, meter labels, meter outlines. Owner UX feedback addressed same session. **Follow-ups from deployment review:** F-051 (spectrum bg too bright), F-052 (meters still bad), F-053 (PHYS IN too subtle).
- **F-056** (PARTIAL FIX, HIGH): Quantum display fix confirmed on Pi. **Xrun counters still OPEN** — `pw-dump` and `pw-cli info` don't expose xrun counts. Need to investigate `pw-top`, `/proc`, PipeWire profiler as alternative sources. **F-061 resolved — Pi verification now unblocked.**
- **F-057** (IN PROGRESS, HIGH): Previous fix `e75b73a` based on incorrect assumption that gain nodes are separate PW nodes. Pi OBSERVE session S-004 revealed they're **params on the convolver node** (`pi4audio-convolver`, id 43). Full `pw_helpers.py` rewrite committed (`65449c6`). Validates L-042. **F-061 resolved — Pi verification now unblocked.**
- **F-051/F-052/F-053** (**RESOLVED** — `774c2ee`): Contrast follow-ups from F-050. Spectrum bg restored to black, meter contrast improved, PHYS IN opacity increased.
- **F-054/F-055** (**RESOLVED** — `93567db`): Graph view HP bypass arc z-order fixed, four gain nodes added.
- **F-058** (OPEN, Medium): E2E screenshot tests write to read-only Nix store path — 6+ false failures in pure sandbox. Task #49 pending.
- **ENH-002** (OPEN, Low): Owner wants tooltips on all dashboard elements. Comprehensive UX enhancement (~50+ definitions).
- **ENH-003** (OPEN, Medium): Sticky latching health indicator with manual clear. Analogous to industrial alarm panel.
- **F-059** (**RESOLVED** — `98a95bf` 2026-03-22): Graph view hardcoded SVG replaced. Part 2 committed. US-064 rework in progress (SPA parser Phase 1 complete).
- **F-060** (**RESOLVED** — tasks #53 + #56): L-042 process doc corrections applied. `nix run .#test-*` as sole QA gate, project-specific details extracted from role prompts to config.md.
- **F-061** (**RESOLVED** — deployed + verified on Pi 2026-03-22): All 6 `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` calls converted to `asyncio.to_thread`. No more subprocess hangs. Awaiting CM commit. **F-056 and F-057 now unblocked for Pi verification.** New issue found during deploy: F-063 (uvicorn single-worker capacity).
- **F-063** (PARTIAL FIX `5e05c0f`, deployed): Thread pool expanded to 32 workers. **Insufficient** — blocking is in async coroutines, not thread pool. See F-064.
- **F-064** (PARTIAL FIX `e77d863`, deployed): Collector timeouts reduced + Nice=10→Nice=0. Web-UI intermittently reachable — partial fix only. **Real fix:** Three-tool RT architecture redesign (eliminates Python relay). **Architect + AE unified design COMPLETE (2026-03-22):** Three binaries sharing `audio-common` crate: (1) `level-bridge` — always-on systemd, 2 PW streams (convolver in+out), WS JSON 10Hz :9100; (2) `pcm-bridge` — on-demand taps only, GM-managed lifecycle, WS binary PCM :9200+; (3) `signal-gen` — unchanged, Python proxy stays for D-009 safety. 5-phase plan: P1 F-064 (done), P2 level-bridge + pcm-bridge WS + shared crate (2-3d), P3 reverse proxy + remove Python relay (1d), P4 GM on-demand taps start_tap/stop_tap RPC (3-5d), P5 measurement session integration (2-3d). Constraints: `node.passive=true` on all taps, per-channel selection in browser JS, GM manages tap lifecycle, web-UI orchestrates measurement workflow, zero data coupling between RT services. **Strategic decisions (Q6-Q8):** **Q6 OVERRULED BY OWNER:** Separate `audio-recorder` service (4th RT binary). Owner rationale: (a) independent use cases exist (record without signal-gen, generate without recording), (b) process separation is cleaner, (c) deconvolution inherently finds time offset — sample-accurate sync not needed. **4 RT tools total:** level-bridge, pcm-bridge, signal-gen, audio-recorder. audio-recorder shares `audio-common` workspace crate, on-demand GM-managed lifecycle. Q7: Web-UI Python owns orchestration (no RT-critical steps outside signal-gen). Q8: No consolidation — **hard security constraint:** safety-critical tier (GM watchdog, signal-gen hard cap) must NEVER share binary with data-plane tier (pcm-bridge, level-bridge, audio-recorder). Same-tier merges permitted if triggers fire but not warranted today. **Caddy** as reverse proxy (not nginx) — auto TLS, simple WS config, solves F-037 auth gap. Web-UI stays Python permanently (control plane = Python, data plane = Rust). **Phasing revised (architect 4-tool update):** Phase 2a (HIGH PRIORITY, in progress): fix collectors to use Rust service RPC instead of subprocess — directly fixes F-061/F-063/F-064. Tasks #92 (GM RPC) + #94 (Python migration). Phase 2b: create `audio-common` Cargo workspace crate (extract shared code). Phase 2c: create `level-bridge` binary. Phase 2d: create `audio-recorder` binary (capture + timestamp + RPC). Phase 2e: strip capture from signal-gen, add `start_clock_position`. Phase 2f: add tungstenite WS to pcm-bridge. Phases 2b-2e parallelizable. Phase 3: Caddy reverse proxy + remove Python PCM relay. Phase 4: GM on-demand taps (`start_tap`/`stop_tap`/`list_taps`). Phase 5: update `session.py` measurement orchestration for 2-service coordination. **Architecture doc:** `docs/architecture/rt-services.md`. **All design questions Q1-Q8 CLOSED.** Tracked under US-060/US-066.
- **F-066** (**RESOLVED** — docs corrected): C-009 Mult persistence verified on Pi. **Result: Mult values are SESSION-ONLY — they revert to .conf defaults on PipeWire restart.** This is the SAFE behavior (runtime pw-cli changes don't survive restart, .conf attenuation always restored). Docs corrected in rt-audio-stack.md, CLAUDE.md, SETUP-MANUAL.md as part of US-071 doc audit. Previous claim that "Mult persists across PW restarts" was misleading — what persists is the .conf file defaults, not runtime changes.
- **F-062** (**RESOLVED** `95aeb0a`): 25 asyncio test failures fixed — `asyncio.get_event_loop()` replaced with `asyncio.run()` across 25 call sites.
- **F-040** (**RESOLVED** — committed `4c80c23` 2026-03-21): Panic MUTE/UNMUTE backend (`audio_mute.py` + `pw_helpers.py`). US-065 and US-064 commits followed (`965f501`, `23a57c1`). No longer blocking.
- **F-041** (**RESOLVED, VERIFIED** — `3a1e6bb` + `c76b882`): Mock server crash fix. Health-check + stderr capture in conftest.py. Additional fix `c76b882`: subprocess.PIPE replaced with tempfile (deadlock prevention). Verified 2026-03-21: full E2E suite completed, no crash. 124 passed, 41 failed (pre-existing regressions → F-048).
- **F-048** (IN PROGRESS → ~1-8 remaining, Medium): Originally 41 E2E test failures. **25 fixed** (system_view, status_bar, visual_regression, event_log — pending commit). **13 fixed** (capture_spectrum + measurement_wizard — pending commit). Remaining: measurement wizard state isolation (F-049, 8 tests hang sequentially).
- **F-042** (**RESOLVED** — `3a1e6bb`, worker-2): 5 E2E assertion fixes. Stale selectors updated, timing adjusted.
- **Rule 13 retrospective** (2026-03-20): 12 code commits (`ff40766`..`3a6fabb`) committed without pre-approval. Architect: **12/12 APPROVED.** AE: **4/4 APPROVED.** AD: no blockers. TW: documentation in progress. All high/medium items resolved. **Resolved items:**
  - ~~TODO (low): u32 saturation comment on `LevelTracker::sample_count`~~ DONE (sg-worker, awaiting commit)
  - ~~VERIFY (medium): Signal-gen per-channel selection RPC~~ CONFIRMED (gm-worker: `set_channel` RPC fully implemented across Rust command/RPC/RT + Python client. US-061 dependency satisfied.)
  - ~~TODO (medium): IIR HPF excursion protection~~ tracked separately (safety.md update, US-061/D-031 scope)
  - ~~T-1 (medium): FilterChainCollector RPC integration tests~~ resolved
  - ~~T-2 (medium): Measurement session GM integration tests~~ resolved
  **Remaining items (4, all low priority):**
  - TODO (low): Document `RegistryHandle` raw-pointer layout dependency on pipewire-rs 0.8 — check on any crate version upgrade (architect)
  - TODO (low): README.md stale CamillaDSP references cleanup
  - TODO (low): HTML element IDs cosmetic rename
  - TODO (low): Consider GM timeout/slow-response tests
  - Process: Commit hold lifted — new work requires architect pre-approval going forward.
- **US-003** (DEFERRED — owner directive 2026-03-16): Was IMPLEMENT 3/4. T3a/b/e PASS. T3d and T4 pending. Work preserved.
- **D-020** (Stage 1+2 deployed): Production dashboard with 4 real backend collectors, spectrum analyzer, HTTPS (D-032). PoC: 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal, optimization deferred to Stage 2). Lab notes: `D-020-poc-validation.md`, `webui-real-data-deployment.md`. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/web-ui.md`. A21 (Reaper OSC on ARM) gates Stage 4.
- **F-013** (partially resolved): wayvnc password auth added. TLS required before US-018.
- **F-016** (open, medium): 2 audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Does not reproduce without restart.
- **US-004** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-21): Assumption register (A1-A28). CLAUDE.md reference corrected.
- **US-000a** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-21): Platform security hardening. F-002/F-011 resolved, reboot-verified.

**New defects filed:** F-049, F-050, F-051-F-061, ENH-002, ENH-003

**E2E test health:** Original 41 failures → resolved. F-041 VERIFIED. 25 pre-existing failures discovered in `nix run .#test-all` — triage pending per L-042.

**Story progress:**
- US-064: DoD 4/8 → **0/8 REWORK** (F-059 — owner directive: real pw-dump topology)
- US-065: DoD 5/10 → 6/10 (E2E test written, F-046 confirm dialog)
- US-066: Phase 1 complete (T-066-1/2/3). Phase 2 needs Pi.
- US-044: T-044-1/2/3/4/5/8 done. T-044-6/7 need Pi.
- US-067, US-068, US-069: stories drafted
- US-070: CI setup story pending draft (owner approved)

**Lesson learned (L-041): CM agent crash — likely memory pressure.**
The Change Manager agent became unresponsive during the overnight autonomous
session, causing all commits to stall. A replacement CM was spawned to clear
the backlog. Probable cause: memory pressure from accumulated context (the CM
handles all git operations and had been processing a high volume of commits).
This is the first observed agent crash from resource exhaustion (distinct from
L-001/L-007/L-008/L-021/L-023/L-031/L-037 which were orchestrator-initiated
shutdowns). Mitigation: monitor for CM responsiveness during long sessions;
the CM role accumulates context faster than advisory roles due to frequent
tool calls (git add, git commit, git status). Consider periodic CM rotation
for sessions exceeding ~20 commits.

**Lesson learned (L-042): Broken tests must always be fixed, never dismissed.
Multi-role review required.**
When E2E screenshot tests failed with `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission
denied: '/nix/store/.../screenshots/...'`, the orchestrator pattern-matched
the error as a "Nix sandbox infrastructure quirk" and directed the team to
skip the failing tests rather than fix the root cause. This violated two
principles: (1) test failures always indicate a real problem — the test setup
was genuinely broken (writing to a read-only Nix store path), and (2) dismissing
failures without a tracked defect erodes test suite trust. Rules:
1. Every test failure is a real problem until proven otherwise with evidence.
2. Never dismiss, skip, or xfail a test failure without filing a tracked defect
   and getting explicit multi-role agreement (QE + AD + Architect minimum).
3. The decision to skip vs fix must be documented with rationale and ownership.
4. The orchestrator must not downplay test failures to avoid blocking progress.
Root cause: the orchestrator optimized for throughput over correctness — a
recurring anti-pattern when under time pressure. The correct response was to
file F-058 immediately and assign a worker to fix the screenshot output path.

**L-042 process docs committed (`17a0cb2`) — owner corrections APPLIED (F-060):**
1. ~~`nix develop` exception~~ **FIXED:** Added `nix run .#test-graph-manager`
   app target to `flake.nix`. All Gate 1 rows now use `nix run .#test-*`.
   Updated: `config.md`, `testing-process.md` (Gate 1 table + Section 10.5),
   `l042-role-updates.md`, `worker.md`.
2. ~~Role/config split~~ **FIXED:** Project-specific test suite mapping table
   moved to `config.md` (Test Suite Mapping section). Worker role prompt
   references `config.md` generically. `testing-process.md` has full detail
   (environment matrix, code quality standards) as process documentation.

**Afternoon commits (17 more, `26957fd`..`546cb54`):**
- `26957fd` — pcm-bridge EXTRA_ARGS → LEVELS_LISTEN env var fix
- `774c2ee` — F-051/052/053: contrast improvements (spectrum, meters, PHYS IN)
- `93567db` — F-054/055: graph bypass arc z-order + gain nodes (superseded by F-059)
- `ab109d9` — ENH-002/003 stories (tooltips + latching alarm)
- `61a2b9d` — docs: status/defects update

- `c953bb9` + `546cb54` — F-060: nix run as sole QA gate, remove nix flake check Gate 2

**Owner approvals (2026-03-22 afternoon):**

1. **3-gate test structure APPROVED.** Gate 1: worker `nix run .#test-*`
   (targeted, every task). Gate 2: full `nix run .#test-all` + E2E (pre-merge,
   story-closing commits). Gate 3: owner Pi acceptance testing (REVIEW phase
   sub-step). WIP limit of 3 stories awaiting acceptance. Documented in
   `testing-process.md`.

2. **CI with GitHub Actions self-hosted runner APPROVED.** Enables branch-based
   parallel work (resolves L-039). Workers on feature branches, merges gated on
   green CI. Story US-070 pending draft. Key decisions: runner on dev machine
   (not Pi — E2E needs Chromium, can't risk audio interference). Modified Rule 9:
   workers may commit to feature branches, CM manages branch lifecycle + merge
   gates, main stays protected.

3. **Graph view rework APPROVED.** US-064 returned to DESIGN (F-059). Must show
   real `pw-dump` topology, not hardcoded SVG. Story revision pending.

**New defects filed this afternoon:** F-059 (graph rework, HIGH), F-060 (L-042
corrections, Medium), F-061 (pw-dump hang, HIGH — fixed `9808a56`).

**Defects resolved this afternoon:** F-051, F-052, F-053 (`774c2ee`), F-054,
F-055 (`93567db`, superseded by F-059), F-056 partial (quantum OK, xrun OPEN),
F-058 (`cb57483`), F-061 (`9808a56`).

**25 pre-existing test failures need triage.** The latest `nix run .#test-all`
shows 25 failures across visual regression (screenshot diffs) and other suites.
Per L-042 these must be triaged by QE + Architect — not dismissed. Each failure
needs classification (code bug / test bug / environment gap) and a tracked defect.

**Session totals:** 40+ commits, 16 defects resolved (incl F-059 part 2, F-061 Pi deploy, F-062), 3 owner approvals, 1 new defect (F-063).

**Late session progress:**
- **US-070 committed** (`6db6f28`): CI workflow YAML + runner setup + `test-everything`.
- **US-064 Phase 1 committed** (`e72de9b`): SPA config parser, 38 tests.
- **F-062 RESOLVED** (`95aeb0a`): 25 asyncio test failures fixed.
- **Visual regression snapshots committed** (`85bb305`): 3 stale PNGs updated.
- **F-061 deployed + verified** on Pi (S-007). F-059 part 2 (`98a95bf`) also deployed in S-007. F-056/F-057 unblocked.
- **US-072 P1-P5 complete:** P1 (`fa9c3ca`), P2 (`5379874`), P3 (`0af215b`), P4 (`4889e62`), P5 (task #80 complete, NOT committed). P6 (task #78) in progress.
- **US-071 partial** (3/9): SETUP-MANUAL overhaul (`d4648a5`), arch/safety/dev docs (`96d7058`). TW report: AC1/AC2 partial, AC3 done, AC4 mostly done, AC5 partial, AC6 not started, AC7 mostly done.
- **F-063 code fixed** (`5e05c0f`), deploy task #82 complete.
- **F-059 part 2 RESOLVED** (`98a95bf`, deployed S-007).

**Reconciliation (2026-03-22 late session):**

*Stalled items (no progress since 2026-03-21):*
- US-050 TEST, US-051 TEST — no QE activity, no worker assigned
- US-052 VERIFY, US-060 VERIFY, US-061 VERIFY — need next Pi VERIFY session
- US-053, US-065 — code complete, remaining items need Pi
- F-056 xrun research, F-057 Pi verification — unblocked but no worker assigned
- F-048 remaining ~1-8 tests, F-060 doc corrections — no worker assigned

*Missing items identified:*
- **US-063 never drafted** — blocks US-060 DoD #3 (processing load) and #7 (xrun counter)
- **US-070 DoD TBD** — no acceptance criteria defined
- **US-071 checkboxes** in user-stories.md — none updated despite committed work

*Dirty tree:* US-072 P5 (kernel-rt.nix) — CM needs to commit.

- config.md updated: co-author line `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` (no model version)

### Key Findings from Brain Dump (2026-03-09)
- **CamillaDSP levels API correction:** pycamilladsp `client.levels.levels_since_last()` provides per-channel peak+RMS for both capture and playback (8+8 channels). This informs D-020 metering design.
- **RT kernel strongly validates D-013:** Peak load nearly halved (35.6% vs 63-70%), buffer trends upward (vs draining on stock), 3C cooler, zero throttle events. RT is unambiguously better for DSP. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022) -- no longer blocking.
- **Monitoring blind spots:** Researcher identified 14 blind spots in current monitoring. Report pending review.
- **Mixxx ran ~10 min on RT before crash** (F-017). First-time combination. No diagnostic data due to volatile journald.
- **Quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL:** 1750 xruns at quantum 128. D-011 confirmed -- quantum 256 is the minimum viable setting on Pi 4B. No need for D-021.
- **D-020 PoC validated:** 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal). 6 deployment bugs found/fixed. pycamilladsp v3 dict API, pw-jack requirement, AudioWorklet secure context, AudioContext suspension. CPU: ~17%, thermal: 47.2C. P8 optimization deferred to D-020 Stage 2.
- **F-012/F-017 root cause CONFIRMED:** V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT. Not app-specific -- any OpenGL client triggers it. DRM/KMS-only (labwc) is stable. Headless audio (CamillaDSP) stable for hours.
- **Option B VALIDATED as F-012/F-017 fix:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` (labwc compositor) + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` (GUI apps) eliminates all V3D usage. Test 4: Mixxx + CamillaDSP FIFO 80 + full audio stack on PREEMPT_RT -- 5 min stable, all 10 checkpoints PASS, peak temp 53.5C, peak load 4.84. `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` alone was insufficient (Event #9 crashed) because labwc compositor still used V3D hardware. Option B fixes the compositor too. D-013 (RT mandatory) is now viable. D-021 pending architect formalization.

### Completed (previous sessions)
- US-000, US-000b, US-001 (16k taps both modes), US-002 (D-011 confirmed), T3e Phases 1-3 (PREEMPT_RT installed + validated), TK-002 (active.yml symlink)

### Completed (this session, 2026-03-12)
- Web UI dashboard deployed with 4 real backend collectors (CamillaDSP, PCM stream, System, PipeWire). HTTPS self-signed cert. Spectrum analyzer with browser FFT.
- D-032 filed: Web UI requires HTTPS for AudioWorklet secure context.
- 8 deployment issues resolved (libjack-pw, AudioWorklet secure context, autoplay policy, pycamilladsp API, pw-top zeros, spectrum signal path, color approach, JACK auto-start). Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/webui-real-data-deployment.md`.
- Architecture doc (`docs/architecture/web-ui.md`) updated: Section 3 stream table rewritten (3 endpoints + 4 collectors), new Section 12 (HTTPS/D-032), new Section 13 (backend collector architecture).
- D-031 driver protection documented across `design-rationale.md`, `rt-audio-stack.md`, `enclosure-topologies.md`.
- Bose PS28 III port tuning measurement: dual-port staggered tuning (58/88 Hz). Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/bose-ps28-iii-port-tuning.md`. Identity updated to `type: ported`.
- Bose Jewel Double Cube satellite near-field measurement: peak 339.8 Hz, usable 200Hz-6kHz. Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/bose-jewel-double-cube-nearfield.md`. Crossover moved 155->200 Hz.
- D-029 per-speaker-identity boost budget + mandatory HPF framework filed and implemented.
- Dashboard review findings (TK-095) persisted into architecture docs: auto-hide rejection, MAIN meters, signal path clarification, SPL metering design.
- Spectrum visual polish: grid lines, frequency labels, overlay, smoothing adjustments (TK-112 color approach pending).
- F-027 RESOLVED: DSP load display showed 2185% (double `* 100` in dashboard.js). Fix: `d742fdf`.
- F-028 RESOLVED: Loopback glitches from ALSA period-size mismatch (1024 vs quantum 256, 4:1 rebuffering). Fix: period-size=256, period-num=8 in `25-loopback-8ch.conf`. Commit `b06d0e5`. Validated 0 errors after 30+ seconds continuous tone (previously 917+).
- F-029 RESOLVED: Level bar 3dB below readout — RMS vs Peak crest factor mismatch. Fix: aligned to same metric. Commit `d742fdf`.
- TK-112 code committed (`cbdcf9d`): Per-bin uniform amplitude coloring in spectrum display. 256-entry color LUT, per-column fillRect. **NOT confirmed by owner** — needs visual validation with audio signal flowing. Deployment to Pi and owner confirmation pending next session.
- TK-124 DONE: system.js `* 100` double multiplication fix (`725f3b9`).
- TK-125 DONE: Dead "click to start audio" overlay removed from HTML/JS/CSS (`725f3b9`). Cleanup after AudioContext elimination (TK-115).
- TK-126 DONE: Tone generator (`jack-tone-generator.py`) enhanced with `--continuous`, `--waveform {sine,white,pink,sweep}`, `--channels` (`7c98c9c`). Backward-compatible.
- Spectrum Playwright investigation: No bug — spectrum works correctly, was empty due to no audio signal playing.
- ~~TK-124/TK-125 web UI fixes committed but NOT YET DEPLOYED to Pi (Pi offline until tonight). Deploy next session.~~ **DEPLOYED** — TK-124/TK-125 web UI fixes deployed and verified on Pi.
- User journeys document (`docs/user-journeys.md`) committed (`9059b63`). 10 operational flow user journeys, 1259 lines. 5 `[TODO: AE input needed]` placeholders remain — AE providing answers.
- D-031 HPF filters deployed to both dj-pa.yml and live.yml on Pi, validated.
- TK-140 closed: nftables port 8080 rule was already persistent. CLAUDE.md firewall section corrected.
- Tier 5 stories filed: US-039 through US-043 (speaker driver database) committed (`f2b2b25`).
- F-030 filed: Web UI monitor JACK client causes xruns under DJ load (HIGH). Workaround: stop web UI service.
- US-005 DONE: Owner confirms Hercules USB-MIDI basic DJ functionality works. Residual mapping deferred.
- US-006 DONE: Implicitly validated — owner actively DJing on Mixxx with Hercules on Pi.
- US-003 T3a PASS: Owner approved based on real-world DJ use. US-029 (DJ UAT) now unblocked.
- CHN-50P speaker identity, profile, and CamillaDSP config committed (`4473d66`).
- Driver database: initial scrape data committed (`36386c7`), Soundimports decimal fix (`3a1643c`).
- TK-141 DONE: Near-field measurement script (`measure_nearfield.py`, 1412 lines) committed (`c906dee`). AE approved. Safety cap, pre-flight checks, xrun detection. 8 deferred follow-ups filed (TK-142 through TK-149).
- TK-143 DONE: CamillaDSP measurement config generation + pycamilladsp hot-swap (`6c65d9b`). 15 new tests. All-hands review passed. Hard cap updated to -20 dBFS per AD defense-in-depth (S-010 near-miss). Follow-up review fixes pending commit.
- D-033 Stage 1 COMPLETE: Multi-user Nix 2.34.1 installed on Pi (S-011). All 5 checks pass. TK-139 unblocked.
- S-010 near-miss reclassified: PA was off, no speaker damage. Defense-in-depth fixes implemented.
- US-044 filed: CamillaDSP bypass protection (safety story). OS-level protections against accidental circumvention of CamillaDSP gain staging. Relates to D-014, S-010.
- D-034 filed: Temporary bass shelf on Bose sub — LowShelf 70 Hz +6 dB Q=0.7 on sub ch [2,3]. Owner approved ("Much better"). AE Rule 13 safe (0.69W vs 62W). Temporary — remove when Path A FIR corrections deployed.
- TK-150 DONE (`130849b`): Bass shelf deployed via pycamilladsp, persisted to disk and pushed.
- D-035 filed: Measurement safety is software-only (4-layer architecture). Production safety remains D-014 scope. AD recommended, owner approved.
- Owner planning brief work packages filed: US-045 (hardware config schema), US-046 (thermal ceiling), US-047 (Path A measurement), US-048 (post-measurement viz), US-049 (real-time viz websocket). US-011b amended (power budget validation). US-012 amended (automated gain calibration ramp). TK-151-154 filed (F-030 fix, JACK CPU investigation, runtime power monitoring, D-034 removal tracker). Story count 48->53. Dependency graph updated.
- Phase 1 completed (WP-1, WP-2, WP-8):
  - TK-155 DONE (`2a2a2f9`): Hardware config schema + thermal ceiling computation. 18 tests. Covers US-045 + US-046.
  - TK-156 DONE: nixGL Mixxx 2.5.4 wrapper in flake. Needs Pi hardware test (TK-139).
  - TK-157 DONE (`3367857`): Config power budget validator. 29 tests. Sub margin +1.7 dB — **AE APPROVED** (worst-case envelope, real-world margin ~11.7 dB). 3 dB minimum margin requirement deferred to Path A.
- TK-158 DONE (`cc3f552`): Safety + architecture doc restructure by TW. New `docs/operations/safety.md`, `rt-audio-stack.md` restructured.
- TK-152 SUBSUMED by TK-151: architect root cause analysis identified JACK client as active RT graph node problem.
- AE approved sub margin (+1.7 dB). Phase 2 UNBLOCKED. WP-3 (gain cal) and WP-4 (pcm-bridge) can start.
- PO gaps addressed: US-011b 3 dB margin deferred per AE, TK-154 DoD updated (AE Rule 13 + power revalidation), US-044 phase flag for owner.
- TK-159 filed: Bose sub profile power_limit_db mismatch (-22.0 vs -19.0 in production config).
- L-039: Task tool `isolation: "worktree"` is broken. Do not use.
- AE detailed margin analysis: Option A (sub_speaker_trim -19.0 -> -20.5) recommended for 3 dB margin. PO decision pending.
- Owner directive (2026-03-14): measurement UI must follow UX-driven development cycle. 5-phase process gate on US-047/048/049. US-050 filed (measurement mock backend). TK-160 (UX design, GATE), TK-161 (specialist validation), TK-162 (architect task breakdown) filed. Story count 53->54.
- TK-159 DONE (`b51e87b`): AE Option A applied — sub_speaker_trim -19.0 -> -20.5 dB, profile power_limit_db aligned to -20.5. 3.0 dB margin achieved.
- WP-3 DONE: TK-163 (`64f2d99`) — automated gain calibration ramp. 437 lines Python + 460 lines tests. 4-layer safety, 20 unit tests. Needs Pi validation.
- WP-4 code written: TK-151 — Rust pcm-bridge in `src/pcm-bridge/` (281 lines). Architect reviewed favorably. Pending CM commit + Pi deployment test.
- TK-160 DONE (`caee7d5` + uncommitted updates): UX measurement workflow design (1040+ lines). AE 3 must-fix + 5 recs all applied by UX specialist.
- TK-161 DONE: All 4 specialist reviews complete with sign-off (AE all accepted, AD all 11 resolved, QE 9/10 resolved + 1 non-blocking residual, architect feasibility confirmed). TK-162 UNBLOCKED for architect task breakdown.
- TK-164 filed (HIGH): 3 required gain cal fixes (GC-01 verification burst, GC-02 xrun detection, GC-07/11 CamillaDSP config verification). Gates TK-163 field deployment.
- US-050 mock backend: architect design delivered (mock at measurement script level, ~200 lines, room simulator reuse). Implementation as TK-165.
- QE non-blocking residual: Section 5.1 gain cal xrun behavior specification (invalidate + retry). Routed to UX specialist.
- OQ1 resolved: `config.reload()` glitch-free for FIR deployment. Caveat: versioned filenames needed (TK-166).
- TK-162 DONE: Architect delivered 8 work packages (WP-A through WP-H) across 4 phases. Filed as TK-165 through TK-172. Phase 1 complete (TK-164, TK-165, TK-166 all done). TK-167 (WP-C) completed but SUPERSEDED by D-036.
- Implementation phase 1 COMPLETE: TK-164 (gain cal fixes), TK-165 (mock backend), TK-166 (versioned FIR filenames, `e5ee386`). TK-167 (WP-C ws_server) completed but superseded.
- **D-036 filed (2026-03-14): Central daemon architecture for measurement workflow.** Subprocess model rejected. FastAPI backend becomes unified control system. Decision count 35->36.
- **D-036 revised breakdown filed (2026-03-14).** TK-167-172 reused with new scope. Critical path: TK-167 -> TK-168 -> TK-169 -> TK-170 -> TK-172.
- **D-036 architecture review COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** All 4 sign-offs: AE APPROVED (non-negotiables met), AD APPROVED (6 findings resolved, 0 residuals), QE APPROVED (testability confirmed, 5 additional test scenarios), architect accepted all corrections. Key refinements: two CamillaDSP connections, `sd.abort()` for mid-playrec interrupt (CP-0), two-tier watchdog (10s software + 30s systemd), startup recovery blocks API/WS via FastAPI lifespan, pcm-bridge in WP-C, 8 cancellation points (CP-0-7) as explicit API contract, 10 test scenarios in WP-H. **TK-167 UNBLOCKED for implementation.**
- **D-036 mock/test milestone COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** 10 commits on main: TK-167 (`037aabc`), TK-168 (`e364203`), TK-169 (`a801e45`), TK-170 (`d1848f4`), TK-171 (`4889c28`), TK-172 (`7e4bf8f` — WP-H + 11 FIX NOW review fixes), TK-186 (`7a81959` — terminal state latching), TK-187 (`12cd511` — Playwright e2e tests), mock fix (`83bbcc3`), e2e test fixes (`3b5c15f`). 23/23 integration tests pass, 14 pass + 1 skip Playwright e2e, 263/263 room-correction pass. All FIX NOW items done (12/12). Code review complete (21 findings, 4 reviewers). TK-173 (`a28cbc6`), TK-174 (`a28cbc6`), TK-175 done. TK-189 filed (MEDIUM): replace MockCamillaClient with real CamillaDSP + null I/O.
- **D-036 Pi deployment blockers RESOLVED (2026-03-14).** 11th commit `ecaa485`: TK-177 (CamillaDSP config swap), TK-190 (mic clipping detection), TK-191 (recording integrity), TK-192 (config re-verification). All 4 FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION safety items done. 58 tests passing (worker-config-swap verified). **Deployment readiness assessment delivered:** 2 infrastructure gaps identified (sounddevice pip install, room-correction scripts in deploy manifest). Supervised first measurement protocol defined (13 steps, PA off mandatory). TK-181 (fragile type checking) and TK-184 (mock abort) remain as non-blocking follow-ups — not safety-critical for supervised first measurement.

### Completed (2026-03-15 session)
- **TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE.** All 6 reviewers APPROVED: AE, Architect, QE (re-verified after conditional reject), AD (re-verified after conditional approve), TW, UX. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `81a7d26`: TK-204 (setup_warning WS handler), TK-209 (unit test _build_measurement_config), TK-210 (unit test _check_recording_integrity), TK-211 (unit test ambient baseline), TK-217 (hard RuntimeError if pycamilladsp missing in production). 20 tickets filed from review (TK-204 through TK-223).
- **TK-224 filed, escalated, diagnosed, partially fixed.** Pink noise glitches during gain cal on Pi. AE identified 3 root causes: quantum mismatch, missing cosine taper, per-step noise regeneration. Cosine taper + pre-gen noise buffer committed. Quantum 2048 fix attempted but caused WirePlumber routing race — reverted (`cc3bbd3`). Thermal ceiling revert (`d4ef061`). Pre-roll silence fix (`9084339`). Medium-term fix deferred to TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream). Owner escalated to HIGH deployment blocker.
- **TK-228 INCIDENT filed.** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy + cascading hotfixes without DoD review. 4 lessons learned: L-018 (PA-off mandatory), L-019 (cancel outstanding instructions), L-020 (never raise safety limit for functional workaround), L-021 (rushed hotfixes cascade).
- **10 new tickets filed:** TK-224 (pink noise glitches), TK-225 (persistent status bar), TK-226 (mini 24-channel meters), TK-227 (dashboard labels), TK-228 (safety incident), TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream), TK-230 (WirePlumber SCHED_OTHER), TK-231 (SPL computation wrong), TK-232 (SPL bar static), TK-233 (ramp overshoot).
- **Nix flake improvements:** `nix flake check` outputs (`381c7c0`), e2ePython for Playwright (`ec9181d`), development HOWTO updated.
- **Owner Pi test results tracked:** 4 issues from pre-roll deployment — playback stutters (maps to TK-230), SPL feels louder than 75 dB (TK-231, HIGH), SPL bar doesn't move (TK-232), ramp may overshoot (TK-233).
- **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct. Perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error.
- **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** Shift from "automate everything first" to "build observable, controllable tools first." Four new deliverables: (1) Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled), (2) persistent status bar + mini meters (TK-225/226 promoted), (3) manual test tool page, (4) spectrum visualization. TK-202 PAUSED, TK-224 PAUSED, TK-229 SUPERSEDED. AD-F006 accepted: validate pcm-bridge (TK-151) on Pi first to prove Rust build chain. Three parallel workstreams: TK-151 Pi validation, TK-225/226 status bar, architect RT signal gen design.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-10)
- TK-055 PASS: Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel: lockup in <2.5 min). Zero lockups.
- D-022 filed: PREEMPT_RT with hardware V3D GL -- software rendering no longer required. Supersedes D-021 clauses 2-4.
- F-012 RESOLVED: V3D ABBA deadlock fixed upstream (commit `09fb2c6f4093`, Melissa Wen / Igalia, merged 2025-10-28). Kernel `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` includes the fix.
- F-017 RESOLVED: Same root cause and fix as F-012.
- TK-054 wont-do: Hardware GL on RT makes software rendering DJ-A stability test unnecessary.
- Kernel upgraded from `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` (stock RPi package, `apt upgrade`).
- DJ-A / DJ-B decision tree collapsed: PREEMPT_RT + hardware GL for everything. Single-kernel operation confirmed.
- F-020 RESOLVED (workaround): PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (`~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire.service.d/override.conf`). Config in repo (commit `9c6f3b1`). T3d and TK-039 unblocked.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-09)
- F-015 diagnosis, workaround, and capture-only adapter design (Phases 1-9)
- F-015 RT vs non-RT comparison (Phase 9f-9h)
- JACK tone generator test script (`scripts/test/jack-tone-generator.py`)
- CamillaDSP monitor script (`scripts/test/monitor-camilladsp.py`)
- Audio path test runner (`scripts/stability/run-audio-test.sh`)
- PipeWire configs: 8ch loopback (hardened), capture-only USBStreamer adapter, USBStreamer ACP disable
- WirePlumber configs: loopback ACP disable, UMIK-1 low priority
- F-018 resolved: all audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80, PipeWire quantum 256, force-quantum, RT kernel)
- Quantum reduction testing COMPLETE: T6-128 FAIL (1750 xruns), D-011 confirmed at quantum 256
- D-020 web UI architecture (`docs/architecture/web-ui.md`)
- US-035 story (Feedback Suppression for Live Vocal Performance)
- F-015 lab note (9 phases), F-017 lab note
- Defects log populated (F-002 through F-019)
- D-020 PoC deployed and validated on Pi (8/8 PASS, P8 marginal). 6 bugs found/fixed. Lab note committed (4f166bf).
- Persistent journald configured on Pi (unblocks all crash investigation)
- F-019 filed (headless labwc regression)
- labwc input fix committed (2764519)
- F-012/F-017 root cause confirmed: V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT
- `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` partially validated (stable without audio, FAILS with audio -- Event #9)
- F-012/F-017 consolidated lab note committed
- T3d attempted on RT kernel -- F-012 crash during setup, deferred to next session
- Event #9: `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` + audio stack = lockup. Workaround insufficient alone.
- labwc V3D compositor confirmed (7 renderD128 mappings, v3d driver)
- Test 3: SCHED_OTHER audio + V3D = LOCKUP. Eliminates priority inversion -- V3D deadlocks regardless of audio thread priority.
- **Test 4 / Option B VALIDATED:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` -- 5 min stable on PREEMPT_RT with full audio stack. F-012/F-017 resolved.
- labwc.service updated with `WLR_RENDERER=pixman`
- Audio confirmed through Mixxx JACK: Master -> CamillaDSP ch 0-1 (mains), Headphones -> CamillaDSP ch 4-5 (engineer HP)
- `99-no-rt.conf` (Test 3 artifact) removed from Pi -- was forcing PipeWire to SCHED_OTHER, causing glitches
- F-020 filed: PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT
- Test 5 committed (0656fc2): V3D client lockup confirms V3D blacklist is mandatory (not defense-in-depth)
- DJ-A strategy alignment (architect + audio-engineer consensus): DJ-A = PREEMPT_RT for BOTH modes (RT + V3D blacklisted + quantum 1024 for DJ, quantum 256 for live). DJ-B = stock PREEMPT for DJ mode (V3D available, hardware GL), PREEMPT_RT for live mode only. Scheduling math validated: audio work per quantum 1024 cycle = ~1.8ms out of 21.3ms deadline (8.5% utilization). FIFO 80-88 preempts llvmpipe SCHED_OTHER unconditionally on RT.
- Pi recovered after Test 5 (watchdog reboot ~22:46 CET). 7-step recovery: PipeWire FIFO 88, quantum 1024, CamillaDSP FIFO 80, Mixxx launched with software rendering. System running stably when session crashed.
- **Session crashed at ~22:48 CET.** Pi was fine -- Claude Code orchestration crashed. All team agents lost. Team state recovered from `~/.claude/teams/wondrous-riding-lerdorf/` inbox files. No uncommitted code was lost (all code changes were committed in 0656fc2 or earlier). Lost items: in-flight team context and the planned DJ-A 15-minute stability test which had not yet started.
- **UPSTREAM V3D FIX FOUND (late evening).** `raspberrypi/linux#7035`: patch by Melissa Wen (Igalia, DRM/V3D maintainer) fixes the exact ABBA deadlock in `v3d_job_update_stats`. Confirmed by 2 reporters on Pi 4B + Pi 5. Kernel trace from MmAaXx500 matches our F-012 root cause exactly (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`, Pi 4B). TK-055 filed: apply patch and test RT + hardware GL. If it works, D-021 software rendering is no longer needed.

### Remaining TODOs

- Split ALSA device access for USBStreamer capture vs playback (production fix for F-015)
- A21 validation: Reaper OSC on ARM Linux (gates D-020 Stage 4)
- 14-blind-spot monitoring map review (from researcher)
- ~~Verify labwc process maps show V3D shared libraries loaded~~ CONFIRMED: 7 `/dev/dri/renderD128` mappings in labwc process, driver is v3d.
- ~~D-021 (RT + GUI architecture)~~ SUPERSEDED by D-022: PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL. No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe. D-021 clause 1 (RT mandatory) and clause 5 (stock for dev) remain.
- ~~**F-020**~~ **RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (commit `9c6f3b1`). Root cause uninvestigated but workaround reliable. T3d unblocked.
- F-019 Headless labwc startup regression (WLR_LIBINPUT_NO_DEVICES removed -- labwc may fail without input devices)
- cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (TK-007)
- Local `nix flake check` on macOS blocked by SQLite cache permission issue (non-blocking, QE report 2026-03-15)
- **TK-237** (MEDIUM): PW 1.4.9 convolver ignores `gain` config parameter. Workaround needed for volume control. Found during GM-12. Related: pw-cli volume is runtime-only (resets on PW restart) — durable gain solution needed.
- **TK-238** (MEDIUM): GraphManager routing table port name mapping needs D-041 one-based indexing. Mixxx uses out_0/out_1, Reaper uses out1/out2, filter-chain uses filter_chain:out_0. GraphManager must map all to canonical one-based identities. Found during GM-12.
- **TK-239** (MEDIUM): Sub routing needs explicit mono-sum in GraphManager routing table. Currently no L+R sum to sub channels. Found during GM-12.
- **TK-240** (LOW): WirePlumber auto-linking bypass — WP creates duplicate links that GraphManager must handle or suppress. Blocks full GM-7 (WP removal). Found during GM-12.
- **TK-241** (LOW, research): Investigate PipeWire macOS build feasibility. PW builds on FreeBSD using epoll-shim (translates epoll/timerfd/eventfd to kqueue). Determine if PW's SPA abstraction layer + epoll-shim approach could enable a macOS build. Would allow development/testing of GraphManager and filter-chain configs on the developer's Mac without needing the Pi. Exploratory — no implementation commitment. Owner directive: file formally, not "mentally note."
- **S-012 / TK-242** (HIGH, safety incident): Unauthorized +30dB gain increase while owner was listening. During Reaper live-mode investigation on Pi. Lessons learned pending. Related: S-010 (previous gain safety near-miss), L-018 (PA-off mandatory).
- **TK-243** (HIGH): `pipewire-force-quantum.service` silently forces quantum 256 at boot — root cause of compositor starvation and mouse freezes. PW convolver RT threads at quantum 256 consume 5.3ms wake cycle (FIFO/88), starving labwc compositor. Must be disabled or quantum managed dynamically.
- **TK-244** (MEDIUM): Stale strace processes on labwc compositor contributing to mouse freezes. Leftover debug processes holding compositor resources.
- **TK-245** (MEDIUM): uvicorn web UI spawning pw-top periodically — unnecessary resource consumption on Pi.
- **TK-246** (MEDIUM): WirePlumber sets channelVolumes to near-zero on convolver capture node — interferes with filter-chain audio path. Root cause and workaround needed.
- **TK-247** (MEDIUM): `bq_lowshelf` at Freq=0.0 produces distortion — degenerate filter, cannot be used for flat gain in filter-chain. PW `linear` builtin works as gain node instead (y = x * Mult + Add), runtime-adjustable via pw-cli.
- **TK-248** (MEDIUM): Per-channel gain required for mixed speaker systems (CHN-50P 7W vs Bose PS28 III 62W thermal limits). Thermal safety calculations needed. Related: D-029 (per-speaker boost budget), TK-155 (hardware config schema).
- **TK-249** (MEDIUM, calibration investigation): PW `linear` Mult parameter IS functional — owner verified during C-005 (heard volume changes at Mult 0.0316 → 0.001 → 0.000631). **Downgraded from CRITICAL.** Remaining question: absolute SPL doesn't match theoretical predictions. Calibration accuracy issue, not a safety blocker. AD Finding #2 RESOLVED, Finding #9 partially resolved (gain mechanism works, absolute margin TBD).
- **TK-250** (MEDIUM): ada8200-in driver grouping via `node.group` — fix for USB device scheduling. The ada8200-in capture adapter needs `node.group` property to be scheduled with the USBStreamer playback device, preventing ALSA contention. Needs PipeWire conf rule and documentation.
- ~~**F-032 / SEC-GM-01**~~ **RESOLVED.** `parse_listen_addr()` in `main.rs:87-106` enforces loopback-only binding (127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost) with 8 unit tests. Service file has SEC-PW-CLIENT hardening. SEC-GM-02 and SEC-GM-03 remain SHOULD-FIX (lower priority).
- **TK-251** (MEDIUM, QE G-4): Stale `test_no_gain_nodes` regression test. QE recommends Option A: update test to validate the 4 `linear` gain nodes exist with Mult <= 1.0 assertion. Quick code fix, blocks DoD #13 QE sign-off. US-059 scope.
- ~~**TK-055**~~ **DONE (PASS).** Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware GL on RT. D-022 filed. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED.
- ~~**TK-054**~~ **wont-do.** Hardware GL available on RT (D-022). Software rendering DJ-A stability test no longer necessary.

## Blockers

- **F-012: RESOLVED (D-022, upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`).** V3D GPU driver ABBA deadlock fixed by upstream commit `09fb2c6f4093` (Melissa Wen / Igalia). Kernel upgrade to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` eliminates the deadlock. TK-055 PASS: 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel locked up in <2.5 min). No V3D blacklist needed. D-021 software rendering clauses superseded by D-022.
- **F-013: PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** wayvnc password auth added. **TLS required before US-018** deployment (guest musicians' phones on network).
- **F-014: RESOLVED.** RustDesk firewall rules removed (TK-048).
- **F-015: RESOLVED (workaround).** USB bandwidth contention from ada8200-in. Workaround: adapter disabled. **Production fix needed:** split ALSA device access.
- **F-016: OPEN.** Audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Root cause TBD.
- **F-017: RESOLVED (D-022, same fix as F-012).** Mixxx hard lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Same V3D ABBA deadlock, fixed by same upstream commit in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. No workaround needed.
- **F-018: RESOLVED.** All audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80 via systemd override, PipeWire quantum 256 via static config + user service, RT kernel via config.txt). Verified.
- **F-020: RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT. **Fix:** systemd user service drop-in with `CPUSchedulingPolicy=fifo` + `CPUSchedulingPriority=88`. PipeWire at FIFO/88 after reboot. Config in repo (commit `9c6f3b1`). T3d unblocked.
