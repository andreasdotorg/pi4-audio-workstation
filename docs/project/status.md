# Project Status

## Overall Status

**US-002 DONE.** Tier 1 validation complete (US-001 + US-002). 16k taps confirmed (US-001). CamillaDSP = exactly 2 chunks latency (US-002). D-011: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256 (~21ms PA path). IEM routing through CamillaDSP passthrough is a net benefit (PA-IEM delta ~9ms, within Haas fusion). US-003 (stability tests) next.

|-------|-------|--------|
| US-000 | 3/3 | **done** (all advisors signed off: audio engineer, security specialist, technical writer) |
| US-000a | 4/4 | in-review (F-002 resolved: CamillaDSP systemd service; F-011 resolved: nfs-blkmap masked; verified across reboot in US-000b T7) |
| US-000b | 13/13 | done (security specialist + architect signed off) |
| US-001 | 4/4 | **done** (all 5 tests pass: T1a 5.23%, T1b 10.42%, T1c 20.43%, T1d 5.21%, T1e 10.39%. 16k taps both modes. A1/A2 validated.) |
| US-002 | 4/4 | **done** (Pass 1 + Pass 2 complete, lab notes written, A3 updated. D-011 confirmed. IEM passthrough = net benefit.) |
| US-004 | 0/3 | ready (independent) |
| US-005 | 0/3 | ready (after Tier 1; Hercules already visible as USB-MIDI — positive signal) |
| US-006 | 0/3 | ready (unblocked by US-000 + US-005) |

## In Progress

- **US-001** (done): CamillaDSP CPU benchmarks complete. All 5 tests PASS. 16k taps confirmed for both modes.
  - T1a: 16k @ 2048 = 5.23% CPU (threshold <30%) — massive headroom
  - T1b: 16k @ 512 = 10.42% CPU (threshold <45%) — plenty of room
  - Zero xruns across all tests, temperature 64-71°C
  - Decision tree outcome: 16,384 taps for both DJ and Live modes (ideal path)
  - Deviation: USBStreamer requires 8 playback channels in CamillaDSP config
  - Note: PipeWire still TS scheduling during benchmarks (RTKit issue to investigate)
  - Assumptions A1 (16k @ 2048 fits CPU) and A2 (16k @ 512 fits CPU) VALIDATED
- **US-000b** (done): Desktop trimming complete, security + architect signed off
- **US-000a** (in-review): 4/4 DoD — F-002 and F-011 both resolved, verified across reboot
- **US-002** (done): Latency measurement complete. 4/4 DoD. Lab notes written (738 lines).
  - Pass 1 (PipeWire/sounddevice): T2a=139ms, T2b=80.8ms
  - Pass 2 (ALSA-direct): T2a=85.7ms, T2b=30.3ms (hardware reference: ~4ms)
  - CamillaDSP confirmed at exactly 2 chunks latency
  - PipeWire overhead: ~21ms per traversal at quantum 1024
  - D-011 confirmed: chunksize 256 + quantum 256 for live mode (~21ms target). Supersedes D-002 for live mode.
  - IEM routing through CamillaDSP passthrough (Approach D) is a net benefit: PA-IEM delta ~9ms (within Haas fusion), vs ~26ms with old direct-bypass model
  - A3 assumption updated in CLAUDE.md. Lab notes T6 latency budget minor correction pending (uses old IEM bypass assumption).
- **Audio engineer proposal for US-003**: Add T3c stretch goal — quantum 128 stability test (30 min, zero xruns)
- **Next:**
  - Commit batch (lab notes + D-011 + status + CLAUDE.md + PO story updates)
  - Technical writer: SETUP-MANUAL 17-location channel update + D-011 chunksize changes
  - US-003 (stability tests): unblocked
- **Remaining TODOs**: cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (US-024 candidate), CamillaDSP needs `active.yml` before service enable, PipeWire TS scheduling issue

## Blockers
