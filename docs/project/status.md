# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing, CamillaDSP for
real-time signal processing, Mixxx for DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal
performance. The system is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for
headless operation, and benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap
FIR convolution on four channels comes in at 5% in DJ mode and about 34% in
live mode with the full 8-channel production configuration -- far below the
limits that would have forced compromises on filter quality. The bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist targets approximately
21 milliseconds at D-011 parameters -- within the threshold where a singer can
perform comfortably.

The automated room correction pipeline (TK-071) is written: 13 DSP modules
covering sweep generation, deconvolution, correction filter computation,
crossover integration, spatial averaging, and D-009-compliant verification.
Bose speaker profiles are measured and crossover filters generated. The next
phase is on-site measurement with real speakers and UMIK-1, plus the remaining
stability tests (T3d, T4) and DJ controller integration (US-005/US-006).

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation nearly complete. DJ mode gig-ready. Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15): build observable, controllable tools before further automation.** US-001 (CPU), US-002 (latency), US-005 (Hercules MIDI), US-006 (Mixxx feasibility) all done. US-003 (stability): T3a PASS (owner approved 2026-03-12), T3b/T3c/T3e done, T3d unblocked (pending Reaper end-to-end), T4 requires physical hardware. US-029 (DJ UAT) now unblocked. D-011 confirmed: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022: upstream V3D fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`). PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL for all modes. Room correction pipeline done (TK-071). Web UI dashboard deployed with real data, HTTPS, spectrum analyzer (D-020 Stage 1+2, D-032). F-030: web UI monitor causes xruns under DJ load (workaround: stop service). Bose speaker profiles measured (PS28 III sub, Jewel Double Cube satellite). Reaper upgraded to 7.64. Speaker driver database (Tier 5, US-039-043) in progress. **D-036 measurement daemon: TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE, then PAUSED.** 6 reviewers all APPROVED. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `f6a0fc4`. TK-202 paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. TK-224 and TK-229 also paused/superseded. **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** (1) Dedicated Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled, replaces Python `sd.playrec()`). (2) Persistent status bar with mini meters in all views (TK-225/226 promoted to essential). (3) Manual test tool page in web UI. (4) Spectrum visualization of mic signal. Gating step: TK-151 (pcm-bridge) Pi deployment validates Rust-on-Pi build chain (AD-F006). **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct — perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error. **Safety incident TK-228:** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy. 4 lessons learned (L-018 through L-021). **Three parallel workstreams:** (1) TK-151 Pi validation (gates RT signal gen), (2) TK-225/226 status bar (no dependencies), (3) architect RT signal gen design.

## In Progress

- **TK-202** (PAUSED): All 6 reviewers APPROVED. Paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. Deployment resumes after RT signal gen operational. Review results preserved.
- **TK-224** (PAUSED, was HIGH deployment blocker): Root cause (per-burst stream opening / WirePlumber routing race) will be addressed by RT signal generator. Previous fixes retained (cosine taper, pre-gen noise, reverts).
- **TK-151** (**DONE — S-001 Steps 3-9 ALL PASS**): pcm-bridge runtime validated on Pi. AD-F006 build chain + runtime both proven. **TK-236 VERIFIED (HIGH).** 8 AUX output ports created and linked to loopback-8ch-sink on Pi (build #8, commit `c3cf92a`). Fix: `audio.position` property in stream props + SPA format pod. Playback: AUX0-AUX7 (8 output ports matching loopback sink). Capture: MONO. 10 regression tests. pcm-bridge capture mode may need same fix (future item).
- **US-056** (CANCELLED — D-040 2026-03-16): CamillaDSP abandoned. JACK backend migration no longer needed.
- **US-057** (CANCELLED — D-040 2026-03-16): CamillaDSP abandoned. PW-native investigation no longer relevant.
- **US-058** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-16): PW filter-chain FIR benchmark. BM2-4 PASS: 1.70% q1024, 3.47% q256. Triggered D-040.
- **US-059** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT COMPLETE, DoD 14/14** — owner-authorized 2026-03-16, D-040): GraphManager Core + Production Filter-Chain (Phase A). **DoD: 14/14 — ALL ITEMS SATISFIED.** #1 GM-0 PASS, #2 filter-chain on Pi, #3 GM written+integrated (GM-13/GM-14 reconciler fix, 142 tests), #4 dual-mode support (signal-gen + pcm-bridge), #5 WP removed (C-008: stopped+masked, graph intact), #6 statically validated, #7 regression tests (QE approved S-1-S-4 + I-1 `92b5120`), #8 stability PASS (conditional — Mixxx 11h+44m + Reaper 1 xrun in 34 min at q256 FIFO/80, owner accepted), #9 latency documented (C-006: PA ~6.3ms PASS), #10 Architect APPROVED, #11 Security APPROVED, #12 AD CLOSED, #13 QE SIGNED OFF (unconditional, 168 tests + I-1 green, all 4 gaps resolved), #14 lab note complete (5/5 topics). **Tracked follow-ups:** F-033 (Reaper JACK bridge RT), I-1 CI wiring, spectral verification (AC line 3141), D-042 lifting (q256 stability). GM tasks: 14/15 (GM-8 CamillaDSP removal tracked separately). HEAD: `8a7a736`. **Next phase: TEST** (L-022 phase gate: DECOMPOSE -> PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> **TEST** -> DEPLOY -> VERIFY -> REVIEW).
- **US-062** (**DONE** — owner-accepted 2026-03-20): Boot-to-DJ Mode (minimum viable auto-launch). **DoD: 7/7 — ALL ITEMS SATISFIED.** #1 q1024 static config (D-042), #2 Mult persistence verified (C-009), #3 Mixxx systemd service (`5bb87b1`), #4 DJ routing script + service (`5bb87b1`+`487bc5d`), #5 reboot test PASS (D-001: 6 iterations, 12 links, zero bypass, q1024, ERR=0), #6 safety review SAFE (architect), #7 owner accepted (sound playing, levels OK). D-001 deployment findings: CamillaDSP system service disabled, WirePlumber unmasked with auto-link suppression (D-039 amendment needed), Mixxx JACK bypass cleanup handled by routing script.
- **O-018 overnight soak** (2026-03-21): 13h 39m uptime, **zero xruns** after 7-min startup settling. 66.7C, 0x0 throttle, 1.0 GiB memory, zero swap. All services healthy. Strong pre-deployment baseline for GM deployment. Validates US-062 boot-to-DJ stability over extended unattended operation.
- **GraphManager deployment / D-002 DEPLOY session** (in-progress — 2026-03-21): GM-7 DONE (`eaf28ae`). GM systemd service committed (`f9473b0`). pcm-bridge env retargeting committed (`0611394`). **D-002 DEPLOY session granted to gm-worker** for US-052/US-060/US-061 deployment to Pi. Owner authorized ("PA is off and safe"). **Deployment status: UNKNOWN** — gm-worker was busy, no results received before session wrap-up. O-018 confirms pre-deployment baseline is clean. Next session must check D-002 outcome first.
- **US-060** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT, DoD 1/7** — owner-authorized 2026-03-20): PipeWire Monitoring Replacement (Phase B). Architect scoped into 6 tasks (US060-1 through US060-6). US060-2 (pcm-bridge retarget) DONE (`0611394`). Track A: US060-1, US060-3 parallelizable. Track B: US060-4, US060-5 sequential after A. Track C: US060-6 cleanup last. Blocks US-050 and US-051.
- **US-061** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT, DoD 0/8** — owner-authorized 2026-03-20): Measurement Pipeline Adaptation (Phase C). Adapts D-036 measurement daemon from CamillaDSP to PW filter-chain. Independent of US-060 (parallelizable).
- **US-050** (ACTIVE — resumed per owner directive 2026-03-20): Measurement Pipeline Mock Backend. CI tier done, E2E tier needs D-040 adaptation. Blocked on US-060.
- **US-051** (ACTIVE — resumed per owner directive 2026-03-20): Persistent System Status Bar. UI structure done (SB-1-7), data source wiring blocked on US-060.
- **US-052** (ACTIVE — resumed per owner directive 2026-03-20): RT Signal Generator. D-040 adaptation: 3 fixes committed (`4796a46`, sg-worker). sg-worker checking remaining DoD items. Graceful startup AC deferred as SG-13 (architect recommendation: systemd Restart=on-failure provides equivalent retry). gm-worker on flake.nix Playwright fix. Was IMPLEMENT 3/6 (6,183 lines, 193 tests).
- **US-053** (ACTIVE — resumed per owner directive 2026-03-20): Manual Test Tool Page. TT-2 + PCM-MODE-3 code preserved. Blocked on US-052. Was IMPLEMENT 3/6.
- **Rule 13 retrospective** (2026-03-20): 12 code commits (`487bc5d`..`02f44cf`) committed without pre-approval. Architect: **12/12 APPROVED.** AE: **4/4 APPROVED.** AD: no blockers. TW: documentation in progress. All high/medium items resolved. **Resolved items:**
  - ~~TODO (low): u32 saturation comment on `LevelTracker::sample_count`~~ DONE (sg-worker, awaiting commit)
  - ~~VERIFY (medium): Signal-gen per-channel selection RPC~~ CONFIRMED (gm-worker: `set_channel` RPC fully implemented across Rust command/RPC/RT + Python client. US-061 dependency satisfied.)

  - TODO (low): README.md stale CamillaDSP references cleanup
  - TODO (low): HTML element IDs cosmetic rename
  - TODO (low): Consider GM timeout/slow-response tests
  - Process: Commit hold lifted — new work requires architect pre-approval going forward.
- **US-003** (DEFERRED — owner directive 2026-03-16): Was IMPLEMENT 3/4. T3a/b/e PASS. T3d and T4 pending. Work preserved.
- **D-020** (Stage 1+2 deployed): Production dashboard with 4 real backend collectors, spectrum analyzer, HTTPS (D-032). PoC: 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal, optimization deferred to Stage 2). Lab notes: `D-020-poc-validation.md`, `webui-real-data-deployment.md`. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/web-ui.md`. A21 (Reaper OSC on ARM) gates Stage 4.
- **F-013** (partially resolved): wayvnc password auth added. TLS required before US-018.
- **F-016** (open, medium): 2 audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Does not reproduce without restart.

### Key Findings from Brain Dump (2026-03-09)
- **CamillaDSP levels API correction:** pycamilladsp `client.levels.levels_since_last()` provides per-channel peak+RMS for both capture and playback (8+8 channels). This informs D-020 metering design.
- **RT kernel strongly validates D-013:** Peak load nearly halved (35.6% vs 63-70%), buffer trends upward (vs draining on stock), 3C cooler, zero throttle events. RT is unambiguously better for DSP. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022) -- no longer blocking.
- **Monitoring blind spots:** Researcher identified 14 blind spots in current monitoring. Report pending review.
- **Mixxx ran ~10 min on RT before crash** (F-017). First-time combination. No diagnostic data due to volatile journald.
- **Quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL:** 1750 xruns at quantum 128. D-011 confirmed -- quantum 256 is the minimum viable setting on Pi 4B. No need for D-021.
- **D-020 PoC validated:** 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal). 6 deployment bugs found/fixed. pycamilladsp v3 dict API, pw-jack requirement, AudioWorklet secure context, AudioContext suspension. CPU: ~17%, thermal: 47.2C. P8 optimization deferred to D-020 Stage 2.
- **F-012/F-017 root cause CONFIRMED:** V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT. Not app-specific -- any OpenGL client triggers it. DRM/KMS-only (labwc) is stable. Headless audio (CamillaDSP) stable for hours.
- **Option B VALIDATED as F-012/F-017 fix:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` (labwc compositor) + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` (GUI apps) eliminates all V3D usage. Test 4: Mixxx + CamillaDSP FIFO 80 + full audio stack on PREEMPT_RT -- 5 min stable, all 10 checkpoints PASS, peak temp 53.5C, peak load 4.84. `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` alone was insufficient (Event #9 crashed) because labwc compositor still used V3D hardware. Option B fixes the compositor too. D-013 (RT mandatory) is now viable. D-021 pending architect formalization.

### Completed (previous sessions)
- US-000, US-000b, US-001 (16k taps both modes), US-002 (D-011 confirmed), T3e Phases 1-3 (PREEMPT_RT installed + validated), TK-002 (active.yml symlink)

### Completed (this session, 2026-03-12)
- Web UI dashboard deployed with 4 real backend collectors (CamillaDSP, PCM stream, System, PipeWire). HTTPS self-signed cert. Spectrum analyzer with browser FFT.
- D-032 filed: Web UI requires HTTPS for AudioWorklet secure context.
- 8 deployment issues resolved (libjack-pw, AudioWorklet secure context, autoplay policy, pycamilladsp API, pw-top zeros, spectrum signal path, color approach, JACK auto-start). Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/webui-real-data-deployment.md`.
- Architecture doc (`docs/architecture/web-ui.md`) updated: Section 3 stream table rewritten (3 endpoints + 4 collectors), new Section 12 (HTTPS/D-032), new Section 13 (backend collector architecture).
- D-031 driver protection documented across `design-rationale.md`, `rt-audio-stack.md`, `enclosure-topologies.md`.
- Bose PS28 III port tuning measurement: dual-port staggered tuning (58/88 Hz). Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/bose-ps28-iii-port-tuning.md`. Identity updated to `type: ported`.
- Bose Jewel Double Cube satellite near-field measurement: peak 339.8 Hz, usable 200Hz-6kHz. Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/bose-jewel-double-cube-nearfield.md`. Crossover moved 155->200 Hz.
- D-029 per-speaker-identity boost budget + mandatory HPF framework filed and implemented.
- Dashboard review findings (TK-095) persisted into architecture docs: auto-hide rejection, MAIN meters, signal path clarification, SPL metering design.
- Spectrum visual polish: grid lines, frequency labels, overlay, smoothing adjustments (TK-112 color approach pending).
- F-027 RESOLVED: DSP load display showed 2185% (double `* 100` in dashboard.js). Fix: `244dd65`.
- F-028 RESOLVED: Loopback glitches from ALSA period-size mismatch (1024 vs quantum 256, 4:1 rebuffering). Fix: period-size=256, period-num=8 in `25-loopback-8ch.conf`. Commit `f9ba574`. Validated 0 errors after 30+ seconds continuous tone (previously 917+).
- F-029 RESOLVED: Level bar 3dB below readout — RMS vs Peak crest factor mismatch. Fix: aligned to same metric. Commit `244dd65`.
- TK-112 code committed (`d149620`): Per-bin uniform amplitude coloring in spectrum display. 256-entry color LUT, per-column fillRect. **NOT confirmed by owner** — needs visual validation with audio signal flowing. Deployment to Pi and owner confirmation pending next session.
- TK-124 DONE: system.js `* 100` double multiplication fix (`13e8c02`).
- TK-125 DONE: Dead "click to start audio" overlay removed from HTML/JS/CSS (`13e8c02`). Cleanup after AudioContext elimination (TK-115).
- TK-126 DONE: Tone generator (`jack-tone-generator.py`) enhanced with `--continuous`, `--waveform {sine,white,pink,sweep}`, `--channels` (`6a66254`). Backward-compatible.
- Spectrum Playwright investigation: No bug — spectrum works correctly, was empty due to no audio signal playing.
- ~~TK-124/TK-125 web UI fixes committed but NOT YET DEPLOYED to Pi (Pi offline until tonight). Deploy next session.~~ **DEPLOYED** — TK-124/TK-125 web UI fixes deployed and verified on Pi.

- TK-143 DONE: CamillaDSP measurement config generation + pycamilladsp hot-swap (`21a8fc7`). 15 new tests. All-hands review passed. Hard cap updated to -20 dBFS per AD defense-in-depth (S-010 near-miss). Follow-up review fixes pending commit.
- D-033 Stage 1 COMPLETE: Multi-user Nix 2.34.1 installed on Pi (S-011). All 5 checks pass. TK-139 unblocked.
- S-010 near-miss reclassified: PA was off, no speaker damage. Defense-in-depth fixes implemented.
- US-044 filed: CamillaDSP bypass protection (safety story). OS-level protections against accidental circumvention of CamillaDSP gain staging. Relates to D-014, S-010.
- D-034 filed: Temporary bass shelf on Bose sub — LowShelf 70 Hz +6 dB Q=0.7 on sub ch [2,3]. Owner approved ("Much better"). AE Rule 13 safe (0.69W vs 62W). Temporary — remove when Path A FIR corrections deployed.
- TK-150 DONE (`6394ab7`): Bass shelf deployed via pycamilladsp, persisted to disk and pushed.
- D-035 filed: Measurement safety is software-only (4-layer architecture). Production safety remains D-014 scope. AD recommended, owner approved.
- Owner planning brief work packages filed: US-045 (hardware config schema), US-046 (thermal ceiling), US-047 (Path A measurement), US-048 (post-measurement viz), US-049 (real-time viz websocket). US-011b amended (power budget validation). US-012 amended (automated gain calibration ramp). TK-151-154 filed (F-030 fix, JACK CPU investigation, runtime power monitoring, D-034 removal tracker). Story count 48->53. Dependency graph updated.
- Phase 1 completed (WP-1, WP-2, WP-8):
  - TK-155 DONE (`45ea67e`): Hardware config schema + thermal ceiling computation. 18 tests. Covers US-045 + US-046.
  - TK-156 DONE: nixGL Mixxx 2.5.4 wrapper in flake. Needs Pi hardware test (TK-139).
  - TK-157 DONE (`c2c44f6`): Config power budget validator. 29 tests. Sub margin +1.7 dB — **AE APPROVED** (worst-case envelope, real-world margin ~11.7 dB). 3 dB minimum margin requirement deferred to Path A.
- TK-158 DONE (`a148190`): Safety + architecture doc restructure by TW. New `docs/operations/safety.md`, `rt-audio-stack.md` restructured.
- TK-152 SUBSUMED by TK-151: architect root cause analysis identified JACK client as active RT graph node problem.
- AE approved sub margin (+1.7 dB). Phase 2 UNBLOCKED. WP-3 (gain cal) and WP-4 (pcm-bridge) can start.
- PO gaps addressed: US-011b 3 dB margin deferred per AE, TK-154 DoD updated (AE Rule 13 + power revalidation), US-044 phase flag for owner.
- TK-159 filed: Bose sub profile power_limit_db mismatch (-22.0 vs -19.0 in production config).
- L-039: Task tool `isolation: "worktree"` is broken. Do not use.
- AE detailed margin analysis: Option A (sub_speaker_trim -19.0 -> -20.5) recommended for 3 dB margin. PO decision pending.
- Owner directive (2026-03-14): measurement UI must follow UX-driven development cycle. 5-phase process gate on US-047/048/049. US-050 filed (measurement mock backend). TK-160 (UX design, GATE), TK-161 (specialist validation), TK-162 (architect task breakdown) filed. Story count 53->54.
- TK-159 DONE (`6c00446`): AE Option A applied — sub_speaker_trim -19.0 -> -20.5 dB, profile power_limit_db aligned to -20.5. 3.0 dB margin achieved.
- WP-3 DONE: TK-163 (`c902c40`) — automated gain calibration ramp. 437 lines Python + 460 lines tests. 4-layer safety, 20 unit tests. Needs Pi validation.
- WP-4 code written: TK-151 — Rust pcm-bridge in `src/pcm-bridge/` (281 lines). Architect reviewed favorably. Pending CM commit + Pi deployment test.
- TK-160 DONE (`7e5b127` + uncommitted updates): UX measurement workflow design (1040+ lines). AE 3 must-fix + 5 recs all applied by UX specialist.
- TK-161 DONE: All 4 specialist reviews complete with sign-off (AE all accepted, AD all 11 resolved, QE 9/10 resolved + 1 non-blocking residual, architect feasibility confirmed). TK-162 UNBLOCKED for architect task breakdown.
- TK-164 filed (HIGH): 3 required gain cal fixes (GC-01 verification burst, GC-02 xrun detection, GC-07/11 CamillaDSP config verification). Gates TK-163 field deployment.
- US-050 mock backend: architect design delivered (mock at measurement script level, ~200 lines, room simulator reuse). Implementation as TK-165.
- QE non-blocking residual: Section 5.1 gain cal xrun behavior specification (invalidate + retry). Routed to UX specialist.
- OQ1 resolved: `config.reload()` glitch-free for FIR deployment. Caveat: versioned filenames needed (TK-166).
- TK-162 DONE: Architect delivered 8 work packages (WP-A through WP-H) across 4 phases. Filed as TK-165 through TK-172. Phase 1 complete (TK-164, TK-165, TK-166 all done). TK-167 (WP-C) completed but SUPERSEDED by D-036.
- Implementation phase 1 COMPLETE: TK-164 (gain cal fixes), TK-165 (mock backend), TK-166 (versioned FIR filenames, `6459f32`). TK-167 (WP-C ws_server) completed but superseded.
- **D-036 filed (2026-03-14): Central daemon architecture for measurement workflow.** Subprocess model rejected. FastAPI backend becomes unified control system. Decision count 35->36.
- **D-036 revised breakdown filed (2026-03-14).** TK-167-172 reused with new scope. Critical path: TK-167 -> TK-168 -> TK-169 -> TK-170 -> TK-172.
- **D-036 architecture review COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** All 4 sign-offs: AE APPROVED (non-negotiables met), AD APPROVED (6 findings resolved, 0 residuals), QE APPROVED (testability confirmed, 5 additional test scenarios), architect accepted all corrections. Key refinements: two CamillaDSP connections, `sd.abort()` for mid-playrec interrupt (CP-0), two-tier watchdog (10s software + 30s systemd), startup recovery blocks API/WS via FastAPI lifespan, pcm-bridge in WP-C, 8 cancellation points (CP-0-7) as explicit API contract, 10 test scenarios in WP-H. **TK-167 UNBLOCKED for implementation.**
- **D-036 mock/test milestone COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** 10 commits on main: TK-167 (`9184065`), TK-168 (`02de836`), TK-169 (`babf4b6`), TK-170 (`5aaa596`), TK-171 (`2489cea`), TK-172 (`031923f` — WP-H + 11 FIX NOW review fixes), TK-186 (`d01b0a5` — terminal state latching), TK-187 (`3305e51` — Playwright e2e tests), mock fix (`2a3c27d`), e2e test fixes (`1ee8737`). 23/23 integration tests pass, 14 pass + 1 skip Playwright e2e, 263/263 room-correction pass. All FIX NOW items done (12/12). Code review complete (21 findings, 4 reviewers). TK-173 (`96e08f4`), TK-174 (`96e08f4`), TK-175 done. TK-189 filed (MEDIUM): replace MockCamillaClient with real CamillaDSP + null I/O.
- **D-036 Pi deployment blockers RESOLVED (2026-03-14).** 11th commit `a545c0b`: TK-177 (CamillaDSP config swap), TK-190 (mic clipping detection), TK-191 (recording integrity), TK-192 (config re-verification). All 4 FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION safety items done. 58 tests passing (worker-config-swap verified). **Deployment readiness assessment delivered:** 2 infrastructure gaps identified (sounddevice pip install, room-correction scripts in deploy manifest). Supervised first measurement protocol defined (13 steps, PA off mandatory). TK-181 (fragile type checking) and TK-184 (mock abort) remain as non-blocking follow-ups — not safety-critical for supervised first measurement.

### Completed (2026-03-15 session)
- **TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE.** All 6 reviewers APPROVED: AE, Architect, QE (re-verified after conditional reject), AD (re-verified after conditional approve), TW, UX. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `f6a0fc4`: TK-204 (setup_warning WS handler), TK-209 (unit test _build_measurement_config), TK-210 (unit test _check_recording_integrity), TK-211 (unit test ambient baseline), TK-217 (hard RuntimeError if pycamilladsp missing in production). 20 tickets filed from review (TK-204 through TK-223).
- **TK-224 filed, escalated, diagnosed, partially fixed.** Pink noise glitches during gain cal on Pi. AE identified 3 root causes: quantum mismatch, missing cosine taper, per-step noise regeneration. Cosine taper + pre-gen noise buffer committed. Quantum 2048 fix attempted but caused WirePlumber routing race — reverted (`96a5725`). Thermal ceiling revert (`28bc9ec`). Pre-roll silence fix (`28e26f4`). Medium-term fix deferred to TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream). Owner escalated to HIGH deployment blocker.
- **TK-228 INCIDENT filed.** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy + cascading hotfixes without DoD review. 4 lessons learned: L-018 (PA-off mandatory), L-019 (cancel outstanding instructions), L-020 (never raise safety limit for functional workaround), L-021 (rushed hotfixes cascade).
- **10 new tickets filed:** TK-224 (pink noise glitches), TK-225 (persistent status bar), TK-226 (mini 24-channel meters), TK-227 (dashboard labels), TK-228 (safety incident), TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream), TK-230 (WirePlumber SCHED_OTHER), TK-231 (SPL computation wrong), TK-232 (SPL bar static), TK-233 (ramp overshoot).
- **Nix flake improvements:** `nix flake check` outputs (`e524c65`), e2ePython for Playwright (`a15881d`), development HOWTO updated.
- **Owner Pi test results tracked:** 4 issues from pre-roll deployment — playback stutters (maps to TK-230), SPL feels louder than 75 dB (TK-231, HIGH), SPL bar doesn't move (TK-232), ramp may overshoot (TK-233).
- **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct. Perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error.
- **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** Shift from "automate everything first" to "build observable, controllable tools first." Four new deliverables: (1) Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled), (2) persistent status bar + mini meters (TK-225/226 promoted), (3) manual test tool page, (4) spectrum visualization. TK-202 PAUSED, TK-224 PAUSED, TK-229 SUPERSEDED. AD-F006 accepted: validate pcm-bridge (TK-151) on Pi first to prove Rust build chain. Three parallel workstreams: TK-151 Pi validation, TK-225/226 status bar, architect RT signal gen design.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-10)
- TK-055 PASS: Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel: lockup in <2.5 min). Zero lockups.
- D-022 filed: PREEMPT_RT with hardware V3D GL -- software rendering no longer required. Supersedes D-021 clauses 2-4.
- F-012 RESOLVED: V3D ABBA deadlock fixed upstream (commit `09fb2c6f4093`, Melissa Wen / Igalia, merged 2025-10-28). Kernel `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` includes the fix.
- F-017 RESOLVED: Same root cause and fix as F-012.
- TK-054 wont-do: Hardware GL on RT makes software rendering DJ-A stability test unnecessary.
- Kernel upgraded from `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` (stock RPi package, `apt upgrade`).
- DJ-A / DJ-B decision tree collapsed: PREEMPT_RT + hardware GL for everything. Single-kernel operation confirmed.
- F-020 RESOLVED (workaround): PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (`~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire.service.d/override.conf`). Config in repo (commit `536f631`). T3d and TK-039 unblocked.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-09)
- F-015 diagnosis, workaround, and capture-only adapter design (Phases 1-9)
- F-015 RT vs non-RT comparison (Phase 9f-9h)
- JACK tone generator test script (`scripts/test/jack-tone-generator.py`)
- CamillaDSP monitor script (`scripts/test/monitor-camilladsp.py`)
- Audio path test runner (`scripts/stability/run-audio-test.sh`)
- PipeWire configs: 8ch loopback (hardened), capture-only USBStreamer adapter, USBStreamer ACP disable
- WirePlumber configs: loopback ACP disable, UMIK-1 low priority
- F-018 resolved: all audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80, PipeWire quantum 256, force-quantum, RT kernel)
- Quantum reduction testing COMPLETE: T6-128 FAIL (1750 xruns), D-011 confirmed at quantum 256
- D-020 web UI architecture (`docs/architecture/web-ui.md`)
- US-035 story (Feedback Suppression for Live Vocal Performance)
- F-015 lab note (9 phases), F-017 lab note
- Defects log populated (F-002 through F-019)
- D-020 PoC deployed and validated on Pi (8/8 PASS, P8 marginal). 6 bugs found/fixed. Lab note committed (29722c0).
- Persistent journald configured on Pi (unblocks all crash investigation)
- F-019 filed (headless labwc regression)
- labwc input fix committed (757e316)
- F-012/F-017 root cause confirmed: V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT
- `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` partially validated (stable without audio, FAILS with audio -- Event #9)
- F-012/F-017 consolidated lab note committed
- T3d attempted on RT kernel -- F-012 crash during setup, deferred to next session
- Event #9: `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` + audio stack = lockup. Workaround insufficient alone.
- labwc V3D compositor confirmed (7 renderD128 mappings, v3d driver)
- Test 3: SCHED_OTHER audio + V3D = LOCKUP. Eliminates priority inversion -- V3D deadlocks regardless of audio thread priority.
- **Test 4 / Option B VALIDATED:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` -- 5 min stable on PREEMPT_RT with full audio stack. F-012/F-017 resolved.
- labwc.service updated with `WLR_RENDERER=pixman`
- Audio confirmed through Mixxx JACK: Master -> CamillaDSP ch 0-1 (mains), Headphones -> CamillaDSP ch 4-5 (engineer HP)
- `99-no-rt.conf` (Test 3 artifact) removed from Pi -- was forcing PipeWire to SCHED_OTHER, causing glitches
- F-020 filed: PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT
- Test 5 committed (1ff916c): V3D client lockup confirms V3D blacklist is mandatory (not defense-in-depth)
- DJ-A strategy alignment (architect + audio-engineer consensus): DJ-A = PREEMPT_RT for BOTH modes (RT + V3D blacklisted + quantum 1024 for DJ, quantum 256 for live). DJ-B = stock PREEMPT for DJ mode (V3D available, hardware GL), PREEMPT_RT for live mode only. Scheduling math validated: audio work per quantum 1024 cycle = ~1.8ms out of 21.3ms deadline (8.5% utilization). FIFO 80-88 preempts llvmpipe SCHED_OTHER unconditionally on RT.
- Pi recovered after Test 5 (watchdog reboot ~22:46 CET). 7-step recovery: PipeWire FIFO 88, quantum 1024, CamillaDSP FIFO 80, Mixxx launched with software rendering. System running stably when session crashed.
- **Session crashed at ~22:48 CET.** Pi was fine -- Claude Code orchestration crashed. All team agents lost. Team state recovered from `~/.claude/teams/wondrous-riding-lerdorf/` inbox files. No uncommitted code was lost (all code changes were committed in 1ff916c or earlier). Lost items: in-flight team context and the planned DJ-A 15-minute stability test which had not yet started.
- **UPSTREAM V3D FIX FOUND (late evening).** `raspberrypi/linux#7035`: patch by Melissa Wen (Igalia, DRM/V3D maintainer) fixes the exact ABBA deadlock in `v3d_job_update_stats`. Confirmed by 2 reporters on Pi 4B + Pi 5. Kernel trace from MmAaXx500 matches our F-012 root cause exactly (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`, Pi 4B). TK-055 filed: apply patch and test RT + hardware GL. If it works, D-021 software rendering is no longer needed.

### Remaining TODOs
- ~~Configure persistent journald on Pi~~ DONE (configured during PoC session, confirmed surviving power cycles)
- ~~Quantum reduction testing on RT~~ COMPLETE: quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL (1750 xruns), D-011 confirmed
- ~~Deploy and test D-020 PoC on Pi~~ DONE (8/8 PASS, P8 marginal. Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/D-020-poc-validation.md`)
- D-020 P8 optimization: JACK callback 871us -> target <500us (deferred to Stage 2 per PO priority)
- ~~Persist nftables port 8080 rule for web UI (runtime-only, lost on reboot)~~ **DONE** — rule was already persistent. TK-140 closed. CLAUDE.md corrected.
- Fix poc/requirements.txt: camilladsp package needs GitHub URL, not PyPI
- ~~F-012/F-017 V3D GPU deadlock on RT~~ RESOLVED (D-022): Upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. No workaround needed. No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe.
- ~~D-013 revision~~ DONE: PREEMPT_RT + hardware GL confirmed viable (D-022). D-021 software rendering clauses superseded.
- T3d stability test: 30-min production-config test on PREEMPT_RT `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` with hardware GL. Reaper end-to-end validation.
- F-016 PipeWire restart glitches (investigate graph clock settling)
- Split ALSA device access for USBStreamer capture vs playback (production fix for F-015)
- A21 validation: Reaper OSC on ARM Linux (gates D-020 Stage 4)
- 14-blind-spot monitoring map review (from researcher)
- ~~Verify labwc process maps show V3D shared libraries loaded~~ CONFIRMED: 7 `/dev/dri/renderD128` mappings in labwc process, driver is v3d.
- ~~D-021 (RT + GUI architecture)~~ SUPERSEDED by D-022: PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL. No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe. D-021 clause 1 (RT mandatory) and clause 5 (stock for dev) remain.
- ~~**F-020**~~ **RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (commit `536f631`). Root cause uninvestigated but workaround reliable. T3d unblocked.
- F-019 Headless labwc startup regression (WLR_LIBINPUT_NO_DEVICES removed -- labwc may fail without input devices)
- cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (TK-007)
- Local `nix flake check` on macOS blocked by SQLite cache permission issue (non-blocking, QE report 2026-03-15)
- **TK-237** (MEDIUM): PW 1.4.9 convolver ignores `gain` config parameter. Workaround needed for volume control. Found during GM-12. Related: pw-cli volume is runtime-only (resets on PW restart) — durable gain solution needed.
- **TK-238** (MEDIUM): GraphManager routing table port name mapping needs D-041 one-based indexing. Mixxx uses out_0/out_1, Reaper uses out1/out2, filter-chain uses filter_chain:out_0. GraphManager must map all to canonical one-based identities. Found during GM-12.
- **TK-239** (MEDIUM): Sub routing needs explicit mono-sum in GraphManager routing table. Currently no L+R sum to sub channels. Found during GM-12.
- **TK-240** (LOW): WirePlumber auto-linking bypass — WP creates duplicate links that GraphManager must handle or suppress. Blocks full GM-7 (WP removal). Found during GM-12.
- **TK-241** (LOW, research): Investigate PipeWire macOS build feasibility. PW builds on FreeBSD using epoll-shim (translates epoll/timerfd/eventfd to kqueue). Determine if PW's SPA abstraction layer + epoll-shim approach could enable a macOS build. Would allow development/testing of GraphManager and filter-chain configs on the developer's Mac without needing the Pi. Exploratory — no implementation commitment. Owner directive: file formally, not "mentally note."
- **S-012 / TK-242** (HIGH, safety incident): Unauthorized +30dB gain increase while owner was listening. During Reaper live-mode investigation on Pi. Lessons learned pending. Related: S-010 (previous gain safety near-miss), L-018 (PA-off mandatory).
- **TK-243** (HIGH): `pipewire-force-quantum.service` silently forces quantum 256 at boot — root cause of compositor starvation and mouse freezes. PW convolver RT threads at quantum 256 consume 5.3ms wake cycle (FIFO/88), starving labwc compositor. Must be disabled or quantum managed dynamically.
- **TK-244** (MEDIUM): Stale strace processes on labwc compositor contributing to mouse freezes. Leftover debug processes holding compositor resources.
- **TK-245** (MEDIUM): uvicorn web UI spawning pw-top periodically — unnecessary resource consumption on Pi.
- **TK-246** (MEDIUM): WirePlumber sets channelVolumes to near-zero on convolver capture node — interferes with filter-chain audio path. Root cause and workaround needed.
- **TK-247** (MEDIUM): `bq_lowshelf` at Freq=0.0 produces distortion — degenerate filter, cannot be used for flat gain in filter-chain. PW `linear` builtin works as gain node instead (y = x * Mult + Add), runtime-adjustable via pw-cli.
- **TK-248** (MEDIUM): Per-channel gain required for mixed speaker systems (CHN-50P 7W vs Bose PS28 III 62W thermal limits). Thermal safety calculations needed. Related: D-029 (per-speaker boost budget), TK-155 (hardware config schema).
- **TK-249** (MEDIUM, calibration investigation): PW `linear` Mult parameter IS functional — owner verified during C-005 (heard volume changes at Mult 0.0316 → 0.001 → 0.000631). **Downgraded from CRITICAL.** Remaining question: absolute SPL doesn't match theoretical predictions. Calibration accuracy issue, not a safety blocker. AD Finding #2 RESOLVED, Finding #9 partially resolved (gain mechanism works, absolute margin TBD).
- **TK-250** (MEDIUM): ada8200-in driver grouping via `node.group` — fix for USB device scheduling. The ada8200-in capture adapter needs `node.group` property to be scheduled with the USBStreamer playback device, preventing ALSA contention. Needs PipeWire conf rule and documentation.
- **F-032 / SEC-GM-01** (HIGH, MUST-FIX before deployment): GraphManager JSON-RPC loopback binding validation. Security specialist finding. SEC-GM-02 and SEC-GM-03 are SHOULD-FIX (lower priority).
- **TK-251** (MEDIUM, QE G-4): Stale `test_no_gain_nodes` regression test. QE recommends Option A: update test to validate the 4 `linear` gain nodes exist with Mult <= 1.0 assertion. Quick code fix, blocks DoD #13 QE sign-off. US-059 scope.
- ~~**TK-055**~~ **DONE (PASS).** Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware GL on RT. D-022 filed. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED.
- ~~**TK-054**~~ **wont-do.** Hardware GL available on RT (D-022). Software rendering DJ-A stability test no longer necessary.

## Blockers

- **F-012: RESOLVED (D-022, upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`).** V3D GPU driver ABBA deadlock fixed by upstream commit `09fb2c6f4093` (Melissa Wen / Igalia). Kernel upgrade to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` eliminates the deadlock. TK-055 PASS: 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel locked up in <2.5 min). No V3D blacklist needed. D-021 software rendering clauses superseded by D-022.
- **F-013: PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** wayvnc password auth added. **TLS required before US-018** deployment (guest musicians' phones on network).
- **F-014: RESOLVED.** RustDesk firewall rules removed (TK-048).
- **F-015: RESOLVED (workaround).** USB bandwidth contention from ada8200-in. Workaround: adapter disabled. **Production fix needed:** split ALSA device access.
- **F-016: OPEN.** Audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Root cause TBD.
- **F-017: RESOLVED (D-022, same fix as F-012).** Mixxx hard lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Same V3D ABBA deadlock, fixed by same upstream commit in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. No workaround needed.
- **F-018: RESOLVED.** All audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80 via systemd override, PipeWire quantum 256 via static config + user service, RT kernel via config.txt). Verified.
- **F-020: RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT. **Fix:** systemd user service drop-in with `CPUSchedulingPolicy=fifo` + `CPUSchedulingPriority=88`. PipeWire at FIFO/88 after reboot. Config in repo (commit `536f631`). T3d unblocked.
