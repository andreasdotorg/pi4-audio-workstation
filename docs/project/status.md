# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing, CamillaDSP for
real-time signal processing, Mixxx for DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal
performance. The system is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for
headless operation, and benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap
FIR convolution on four channels comes in at 5% in DJ mode and about 34% in
live mode with the full 8-channel production configuration -- far below the
limits that would have forced compromises on filter quality. The bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist targets approximately
21 milliseconds at D-011 parameters -- within the threshold where a singer can
perform comfortably.

The automated room correction pipeline (TK-071) is written: 13 DSP modules
covering sweep generation, deconvolution, correction filter computation,
crossover integration, spatial averaging, and D-009-compliant verification.
Bose speaker profiles are measured and crossover filters generated. The next
phase is on-site measurement with real speakers and UMIK-1, plus the remaining
stability tests (T3d, T4) and DJ controller integration (US-005/US-006).

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation nearly complete. DJ mode gig-ready. Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15): build observable, controllable tools before further automation.** US-001 (CPU), US-002 (latency), US-005 (Hercules MIDI), US-006 (Mixxx feasibility) all done. US-003 (stability): T3a PASS (owner approved 2026-03-12), T3b/T3c/T3e done, T3d unblocked (pending Reaper end-to-end), T4 requires physical hardware. US-029 (DJ UAT) now unblocked. D-011 confirmed: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022: upstream V3D fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`). PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL for all modes. Room correction pipeline done (TK-071). Web UI dashboard deployed with real data, HTTPS, spectrum analyzer (D-020 Stage 1+2, D-032). F-030: web UI monitor causes xruns under DJ load (workaround: stop service). Bose speaker profiles measured (PS28 III sub, Jewel Double Cube satellite). Reaper upgraded to 7.64. Speaker driver database (Tier 5, US-039-043) in progress. **D-036 measurement daemon: TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE, then PAUSED.** 6 reviewers all APPROVED. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `f6a0fc4`. TK-202 paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. TK-224 and TK-229 also paused/superseded. **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** (1) Dedicated Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled, replaces Python `sd.playrec()`). (2) Persistent status bar with mini meters in all views (TK-225/226 promoted to essential). (3) Manual test tool page in web UI. (4) Spectrum visualization of mic signal. Gating step: TK-151 (pcm-bridge) Pi deployment validates Rust-on-Pi build chain (AD-F006). **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct — perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error. **Safety incident TK-228:** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy. 4 lessons learned (L-018 through L-021). **Three parallel workstreams:** (1) TK-151 Pi validation (gates RT signal gen), (2) TK-225/226 status bar (no dependencies), (3) architect RT signal gen design.

## In Progress

- **TK-202** (PAUSED): All 6 reviewers APPROVED. Paused due to owner strategic pivot — RT signal generator will address TK-224 root cause architecturally. Deployment resumes after RT signal gen operational. Review results preserved.
- **TK-224** (PAUSED, was HIGH deployment blocker): Root cause (per-burst stream opening / WirePlumber routing race) will be addressed by RT signal generator. Previous fixes retained (cosine taper, pre-gen noise, reverts).
- **TK-151** (in-progress, now gates RT signal gen): Rust pcm-bridge code written (281 lines). **S-001 Nix build chain FIXED on Pi (2026-03-15):** all 87 crate deps compile, bindgen works. **Type fix committed (`77e7710`):** pipewire-rs 0.8.0 non-Rc types — 3 compile errors resolved, code now compiles. **Next: Pi deployment test (Steps 3-10).** AD-F006: successful deployment validates Rust-on-Pi build chain for RT signal generator.
- **US-051** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — blocked on DEPLOY for SB-7b Pi validation): Persistent system status bar with channel meters. SB-1 through SB-6 DONE, SB-4 DONE (reopened then completed). SB-7 Phase A PASS (12/12). SB-7 Phase B (live Pi testing) pending deployment. All code committed locally. **QE test plan TP-003 delivered** (`6a75940`, 37 criteria). Cannot advance to TEST until SB-7 Phase B completes on Pi; test plan ready to execute when it does.
- **US-052** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — 9/12 subtasks done, **all local Rust code complete**): Real-time signal generator in Rust (6,183 lines, 8 modules). D-037 APPROVED (TK-234 DONE). SG-1 through SG-9 ALL DONE. **SG-10 READY (systemd service + Pi deployment).** SG-11/12 blocked on SG-10. Critical path: SG-10->SG-11->SG-12 — **all require Pi.** TK-151 Pi build chain validated (`77e7710`), pending Pi deployment test (Steps 3-10). Supersedes TK-229. Blocks US-053, US-047, US-012.
- **US-050** (Phase: **REVIEW** — all advisors signed off, pending owner acceptance): Measurement pipeline mock backend. All code committed (`6cf1d12`, `3b73bb3`). Full test suite PASS (15/15 e2e + 282/282 regression). DEPLOY/VERIFY skipped (mock backend, no Pi component). **All 3 advisors APPROVED:** Architect (testability architecture sound), QE (test coverage adequate, 2 observations), AE (mock accurately represents measurement environment, 2 observations). 4 observations total (all non-blocking, tracked for future stories). **Pending owner acceptance for done.** Blocks US-047.
- **US-053** (Phase: **IMPLEMENT** — TT-1 scaffold done, blocked on US-051+US-052): Manual test tool page. TT-1 HTML/CSS scaffold DONE (`f3fcfa2`). UX spec complete (`test-tool-page.md`). Full functionality blocked on US-052 (signal gen backend) and US-051 (persistent status bar frame).
- **US-003** (in-progress): **T3a PASS** (owner approved 2026-03-12 based on real-world DJ use). T3b PASS, T3c informational, T3e PASS, T6-128 FAIL (quantum 256 floor). TK-055 PASS (V3D RT fix). T3d unblocked -- pending Reaper end-to-end. T4 requires physical hardware. **US-005 and US-006 now DONE** -- T3a no longer blocked.
- **D-020** (Stage 1+2 deployed): Production dashboard with 4 real backend collectors, spectrum analyzer, HTTPS (D-032). PoC: 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal, optimization deferred to Stage 2). Lab notes: `D-020-poc-validation.md`, `webui-real-data-deployment.md`. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/web-ui.md`. A21 (Reaper OSC on ARM) gates Stage 4.
- **F-013** (partially resolved): wayvnc password auth added. TLS required before US-018.
- **F-016** (open, medium): 2 audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Does not reproduce without restart.
- **US-004** (in-review): Assumption register (A1-A26). Gap: A27 not in register. Pending DoD sign-off.
- **US-000a** (in-review): 4/4 DoD -- F-002 and F-011 both resolved, verified across reboot

### Key Findings from Brain Dump (2026-03-09)
- **CamillaDSP levels API correction:** pycamilladsp `client.levels.levels_since_last()` provides per-channel peak+RMS for both capture and playback (8+8 channels). This informs D-020 metering design.
- **RT kernel strongly validates D-013:** Peak load nearly halved (35.6% vs 63-70%), buffer trends upward (vs draining on stock), 3C cooler, zero throttle events. RT is unambiguously better for DSP. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED (D-022) -- no longer blocking.
- **Monitoring blind spots:** Researcher identified 14 blind spots in current monitoring. Report pending review.
- **Mixxx ran ~10 min on RT before crash** (F-017). First-time combination. No diagnostic data due to volatile journald.
- **Quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL:** 1750 xruns at quantum 128. D-011 confirmed -- quantum 256 is the minimum viable setting on Pi 4B. No need for D-021.
- **D-020 PoC validated:** 8/8 PASS (P8 marginal). 6 deployment bugs found/fixed. pycamilladsp v3 dict API, pw-jack requirement, AudioWorklet secure context, AudioContext suspension. CPU: ~17%, thermal: 47.2C. P8 optimization deferred to D-020 Stage 2.
- **F-012/F-017 root cause CONFIRMED:** V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT. Not app-specific -- any OpenGL client triggers it. DRM/KMS-only (labwc) is stable. Headless audio (CamillaDSP) stable for hours.
- **Option B VALIDATED as F-012/F-017 fix:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` (labwc compositor) + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` (GUI apps) eliminates all V3D usage. Test 4: Mixxx + CamillaDSP FIFO 80 + full audio stack on PREEMPT_RT -- 5 min stable, all 10 checkpoints PASS, peak temp 53.5C, peak load 4.84. `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` alone was insufficient (Event #9 crashed) because labwc compositor still used V3D hardware. Option B fixes the compositor too. D-013 (RT mandatory) is now viable. D-021 pending architect formalization.

### Completed (previous sessions)

- TK-162 DONE: Architect delivered 8 work packages (WP-A through WP-H) across 4 phases. Filed as TK-165 through TK-172. Phase 1 complete (TK-164, TK-165, TK-166 all done). TK-167 (WP-C) completed but SUPERSEDED by D-036.
- Implementation phase 1 COMPLETE: TK-164 (gain cal fixes), TK-165 (mock backend), TK-166 (versioned FIR filenames, `6459f32`). TK-167 (WP-C ws_server) completed but superseded.
- **D-036 filed (2026-03-14): Central daemon architecture for measurement workflow.** Subprocess model rejected. FastAPI backend becomes unified control system. Decision count 35->36.
- **D-036 revised breakdown filed (2026-03-14).** TK-167-172 reused with new scope. Critical path: TK-167 -> TK-168 -> TK-169 -> TK-170 -> TK-172.
- **D-036 architecture review COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** All 4 sign-offs: AE APPROVED (non-negotiables met), AD APPROVED (6 findings resolved, 0 residuals), QE APPROVED (testability confirmed, 5 additional test scenarios), architect accepted all corrections. Key refinements: two CamillaDSP connections, `sd.abort()` for mid-playrec interrupt (CP-0), two-tier watchdog (10s software + 30s systemd), startup recovery blocks API/WS via FastAPI lifespan, pcm-bridge in WP-C, 8 cancellation points (CP-0-7) as explicit API contract, 10 test scenarios in WP-H. **TK-167 UNBLOCKED for implementation.**
- **D-036 mock/test milestone COMPLETE (2026-03-14).** 10 commits on main: TK-167 (`9184065`), TK-168 (`02de836`), TK-169 (`babf4b6`), TK-170 (`5aaa596`), TK-171 (`2489cea`), TK-172 (`031923f` — WP-H + 11 FIX NOW review fixes), TK-186 (`d01b0a5` — terminal state latching), TK-187 (`3305e51` — Playwright e2e tests), mock fix (`2a3c27d`), e2e test fixes (`1ee8737`). 23/23 integration tests pass, 14 pass + 1 skip Playwright e2e, 263/263 room-correction pass. All FIX NOW items done (12/12). Code review complete (21 findings, 4 reviewers). TK-173 (`96e08f4`), TK-174 (`96e08f4`), TK-175 done. TK-189 filed (MEDIUM): replace MockCamillaClient with real CamillaDSP + null I/O.
- **D-036 Pi deployment blockers RESOLVED (2026-03-14).** 11th commit `a545c0b`: TK-177 (CamillaDSP config swap), TK-190 (mic clipping detection), TK-191 (recording integrity), TK-192 (config re-verification). All 4 FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION safety items done. 58 tests passing (worker-config-swap verified). **Deployment readiness assessment delivered:** 2 infrastructure gaps identified (sounddevice pip install, room-correction scripts in deploy manifest). Supervised first measurement protocol defined (13 steps, PA off mandatory). TK-181 (fragile type checking) and TK-184 (mock abort) remain as non-blocking follow-ups — not safety-critical for supervised first measurement.

### Completed (2026-03-15 session)
- **TK-202 DoD review COMPLETE.** All 6 reviewers APPROVED: AE, Architect, QE (re-verified after conditional reject), AD (re-verified after conditional approve), TW, UX. 5 must-fix blockers resolved in `f6a0fc4`: TK-204 (setup_warning WS handler), TK-209 (unit test _build_measurement_config), TK-210 (unit test _check_recording_integrity), TK-211 (unit test ambient baseline), TK-217 (hard RuntimeError if pycamilladsp missing in production). 20 tickets filed from review (TK-204 through TK-223).
- **TK-224 filed, escalated, diagnosed, partially fixed.** Pink noise glitches during gain cal on Pi. AE identified 3 root causes: quantum mismatch, missing cosine taper, per-step noise regeneration. Cosine taper + pre-gen noise buffer committed. Quantum 2048 fix attempted but caused WirePlumber routing race — reverted (`96a5725`). Thermal ceiling revert (`28bc9ec`). Pre-roll silence fix (`28e26f4`). Medium-term fix deferred to TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream). Owner escalated to HIGH deployment blocker.
- **TK-228 INCIDENT filed.** PA-on deployment + unauthorized thermal ceiling deploy + cascading hotfixes without DoD review. 4 lessons learned: L-018 (PA-off mandatory), L-019 (cancel outstanding instructions), L-020 (never raise safety limit for functional workaround), L-021 (rushed hotfixes cascade).
- **10 new tickets filed:** TK-224 (pink noise glitches), TK-225 (persistent status bar), TK-226 (mini 24-channel meters), TK-227 (dashboard labels), TK-228 (safety incident), TK-229 (persistent PortAudio stream), TK-230 (WirePlumber SCHED_OTHER), TK-231 (SPL computation wrong), TK-232 (SPL bar static), TK-233 (ramp overshoot).
- **Nix flake improvements:** `nix flake check` outputs (`e524c65`), e2ePython for Playwright (`a15881d`), development HOWTO updated.
- **Owner Pi test results tracked:** 4 issues from pre-roll deployment — playback stutters (maps to TK-230), SPL feels louder than 75 dB (TK-231, HIGH), SPL bar doesn't move (TK-232), ramp may overshoot (TK-233).
- **TK-231 RESOLVED:** AE confirmed 121.4 sensitivity constant correct. Perceived loudness explained by pink noise crest factor (peaks 85-87 dB at 75 dB RMS) + Z-weighting vs A-weighting. Not a computation error.
- **Owner strategic pivot (2026-03-15):** Shift from "automate everything first" to "build observable, controllable tools first." Four new deliverables: (1) Rust RT signal generator (always-on audio graph pipe, RPC-controlled), (2) persistent status bar + mini meters (TK-225/226 promoted), (3) manual test tool page, (4) spectrum visualization. TK-202 PAUSED, TK-224 PAUSED, TK-229 SUPERSEDED. AD-F006 accepted: validate pcm-bridge (TK-151) on Pi first to prove Rust build chain. Three parallel workstreams: TK-151 Pi validation, TK-225/226 status bar, architect RT signal gen design.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-10)
- TK-055 PASS: Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel: lockup in <2.5 min). Zero lockups.
- D-022 filed: PREEMPT_RT with hardware V3D GL -- software rendering no longer required. Supersedes D-021 clauses 2-4.
- F-012 RESOLVED: V3D ABBA deadlock fixed upstream (commit `09fb2c6f4093`, Melissa Wen / Igalia, merged 2025-10-28). Kernel `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` includes the fix.
- F-017 RESOLVED: Same root cause and fix as F-012.
- TK-054 wont-do: Hardware GL on RT makes software rendering DJ-A stability test unnecessary.
- Kernel upgraded from `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` (stock RPi package, `apt upgrade`).
- DJ-A / DJ-B decision tree collapsed: PREEMPT_RT + hardware GL for everything. Single-kernel operation confirmed.
- F-020 RESOLVED (workaround): PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (`~/.config/systemd/user/pipewire.service.d/override.conf`). Config in repo (commit `536f631`). T3d and TK-039 unblocked.

### Completed (previous session, 2026-03-09)
- F-015 diagnosis, workaround, and capture-only adapter design (Phases 1-9)
- F-015 RT vs non-RT comparison (Phase 9f-9h)
- JACK tone generator test script (`scripts/test/jack-tone-generator.py`)
- CamillaDSP monitor script (`scripts/test/monitor-camilladsp.py`)
- Audio path test runner (`scripts/stability/run-audio-test.sh`)
- PipeWire configs: 8ch loopback (hardened), capture-only USBStreamer adapter, USBStreamer ACP disable
- WirePlumber configs: loopback ACP disable, UMIK-1 low priority
- F-018 resolved: all audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80, PipeWire quantum 256, force-quantum, RT kernel)
- Quantum reduction testing COMPLETE: T6-128 FAIL (1750 xruns), D-011 confirmed at quantum 256
- D-020 web UI architecture (`docs/architecture/web-ui.md`)
- US-035 story (Feedback Suppression for Live Vocal Performance)
- F-015 lab note (9 phases), F-017 lab note
- Defects log populated (F-002 through F-019)
- D-020 PoC deployed and validated on Pi (8/8 PASS, P8 marginal). 6 bugs found/fixed. Lab note committed (29722c0).
- Persistent journald configured on Pi (unblocks all crash investigation)
- F-019 filed (headless labwc regression)
- labwc input fix committed (757e316)
- F-012/F-017 root cause confirmed: V3D GPU driver deadlock on PREEMPT_RT
- `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` partially validated (stable without audio, FAILS with audio -- Event #9)
- F-012/F-017 consolidated lab note committed
- T3d attempted on RT kernel -- F-012 crash during setup, deferred to next session
- Event #9: `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` + audio stack = lockup. Workaround insufficient alone.
- labwc V3D compositor confirmed (7 renderD128 mappings, v3d driver)
- Test 3: SCHED_OTHER audio + V3D = LOCKUP. Eliminates priority inversion -- V3D deadlocks regardless of audio thread priority.
- **Test 4 / Option B VALIDATED:** `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` + `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` -- 5 min stable on PREEMPT_RT with full audio stack. F-012/F-017 resolved.
- labwc.service updated with `WLR_RENDERER=pixman`
- Audio confirmed through Mixxx JACK: Master -> CamillaDSP ch 0-1 (mains), Headphones -> CamillaDSP ch 4-5 (engineer HP)
- `99-no-rt.conf` (Test 3 artifact) removed from Pi -- was forcing PipeWire to SCHED_OTHER, causing glitches
- F-020 filed: PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT
- Test 5 committed (1ff916c): V3D client lockup confirms V3D blacklist is mandatory (not defense-in-depth)
- DJ-A strategy alignment (architect + audio-engineer consensus): DJ-A = PREEMPT_RT for BOTH modes (RT + V3D blacklisted + quantum 1024 for DJ, quantum 256 for live). DJ-B = stock PREEMPT for DJ mode (V3D available, hardware GL), PREEMPT_RT for live mode only. Scheduling math validated: audio work per quantum 1024 cycle = ~1.8ms out of 21.3ms deadline (8.5% utilization). FIFO 80-88 preempts llvmpipe SCHED_OTHER unconditionally on RT.
- Pi recovered after Test 5 (watchdog reboot ~22:46 CET). 7-step recovery: PipeWire FIFO 88, quantum 1024, CamillaDSP FIFO 80, Mixxx launched with software rendering. System running stably when session crashed.
- **Session crashed at ~22:48 CET.** Pi was fine -- Claude Code orchestration crashed. All team agents lost. Team state recovered from `~/.claude/teams/wondrous-riding-lerdorf/` inbox files. No uncommitted code was lost (all code changes were committed in 1ff916c or earlier). Lost items: in-flight team context and the planned DJ-A 15-minute stability test which had not yet started.
- **UPSTREAM V3D FIX FOUND (late evening).** `raspberrypi/linux#7035`: patch by Melissa Wen (Igalia, DRM/V3D maintainer) fixes the exact ABBA deadlock in `v3d_job_update_stats`. Confirmed by 2 reporters on Pi 4B + Pi 5. Kernel trace from MmAaXx500 matches our F-012 root cause exactly (`6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`, Pi 4B). TK-055 filed: apply patch and test RT + hardware GL. If it works, D-021 software rendering is no longer needed.

### Remaining TODOs

- D-020 P8 optimization: JACK callback 871us -> target <500us (deferred to Stage 2 per PO priority)
- ~~Persist nftables port 8080 rule for web UI (runtime-only, lost on reboot)~~ **DONE** — rule was already persistent. TK-140 closed. CLAUDE.md corrected.
- Fix poc/requirements.txt: camilladsp package needs GitHub URL, not PyPI
- ~~F-012/F-017 V3D GPU deadlock on RT~~ RESOLVED (D-022): Upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. No workaround needed. No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe.
- ~~D-013 revision~~ DONE: PREEMPT_RT + hardware GL confirmed viable (D-022). D-021 software rendering clauses superseded.
- T3d stability test: 30-min production-config test on PREEMPT_RT `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` with hardware GL. Reaper end-to-end validation.
- F-016 PipeWire restart glitches (investigate graph clock settling)
- Split ALSA device access for USBStreamer capture vs playback (production fix for F-015)
- A21 validation: Reaper OSC on ARM Linux (gates D-020 Stage 4)
- 14-blind-spot monitoring map review (from researcher)
- ~~Verify labwc process maps show V3D shared libraries loaded~~ CONFIRMED: 7 `/dev/dri/renderD128` mappings in labwc process, driver is v3d.
- ~~D-021 (RT + GUI architecture)~~ SUPERSEDED by D-022: PREEMPT_RT + hardware V3D GL. No V3D blacklist, no pixman, no llvmpipe. D-021 clause 1 (RT mandatory) and clause 5 (stock for dev) remain.
- ~~**F-020**~~ **RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire FIFO/88 persisted via systemd user service drop-in (commit `536f631`). Root cause uninvestigated but workaround reliable. T3d unblocked.
- F-019 Headless labwc startup regression (WLR_LIBINPUT_NO_DEVICES removed -- labwc may fail without input devices)
- cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (TK-007)
- Local `nix flake check` on macOS blocked by SQLite cache permission issue (non-blocking, QE report 2026-03-15)
- ~~**TK-055**~~ **DONE (PASS).** Upstream V3D RT fix confirmed in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. 37+ min stable with hardware GL on RT. D-022 filed. F-012/F-017 RESOLVED.
- ~~**TK-054**~~ **wont-do.** Hardware GL available on RT (D-022). Software rendering DJ-A stability test no longer necessary.

## Blockers

- **F-012: RESOLVED (D-022, upstream fix in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`).** V3D GPU driver ABBA deadlock fixed by upstream commit `09fb2c6f4093` (Melissa Wen / Igalia). Kernel upgrade to `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` eliminates the deadlock. TK-055 PASS: 37+ min stable with hardware V3D GL on PREEMPT_RT (previous kernel locked up in <2.5 min). No V3D blacklist needed. D-021 software rendering clauses superseded by D-022.
- **F-013: PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** wayvnc password auth added. **TLS required before US-018** deployment (guest musicians' phones on network).
- **F-014: RESOLVED.** RustDesk firewall rules removed (TK-048).
- **F-015: RESOLVED (workaround).** USB bandwidth contention from ada8200-in. Workaround: adapter disabled. **Production fix needed:** split ALSA device access.
- **F-016: OPEN.** Audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Root cause TBD.
- **F-017: RESOLVED (D-022, same fix as F-012).** Mixxx hard lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Same V3D ABBA deadlock, fixed by same upstream commit in `6.12.62+rpt-rpi-v8-rt`. No workaround needed.
- **F-018: RESOLVED.** All audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80 via systemd override, PipeWire quantum 256 via static config + user service, RT kernel via config.txt). Verified.
- **F-020: RESOLVED (workaround).** PipeWire RT module fails to self-promote to SCHED_FIFO on PREEMPT_RT. **Fix:** systemd user service drop-in with `CPUSchedulingPolicy=fifo` + `CPUSchedulingPriority=88`. PipeWire at FIFO/88 after reboot. Config in repo (commit `536f631`). T3d unblocked.
