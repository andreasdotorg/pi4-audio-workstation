# Project Status

The project started with a basic question -- can a Raspberry Pi 4B replace a
Windows PC as a live sound processor? -- and has spent its first phase proving
that the answer is yes, with margin to spare.

The Pi now runs a complete audio stack: PipeWire for routing, CamillaDSP for
real-time signal processing, Mixxx for DJ sets, and Reaper for live vocal
performance. The system is hardened for venue WiFi networks, trimmed for
headless operation, and benchmarked under load. CPU consumption for 16,384-tap
FIR convolution on four channels comes in at 5% in DJ mode and about 34% in
live mode with the full 8-channel production configuration -- far below the
limits that would have forced compromises on filter quality. The bone-to-electronic latency for the vocalist targets approximately
21 milliseconds at D-011 parameters -- within the threshold where a singer can
perform comfortably.

The next phase is the automated room correction pipeline: the software that
measures each venue, computes correction filters, and deploys them. Everything
validated so far -- the filter design, the CPU budget, the latency model --
feeds into that pipeline. The foundation is solid; the interesting work is
ahead.

## Overall Status

**Tier 1 validation in progress.** US-001 (CPU) and US-002 (latency) both done. US-003 (stability tests) in progress -- T3b/T3c/T3e done, T6-128 FAIL (1750 xruns), T3d unblocked by F-015 fix, T3a blocked on external deps, T4 requires physical hardware. US-004 (assumption register) selected. D-011 confirmed: live mode chunksize 256 + quantum 256 -- quantum 128 tested and failed catastrophically (1750 xruns), 256 is the Pi 4B hardware floor. IEM through CamillaDSP passthrough confirmed as net benefit. First end-to-end Reaper test exposed F-015 (USB bandwidth contention) -- fixed with workaround, production fix pending. D-020 (web UI architecture) committed. F-018 (config persistence) resolved -- all audio configs persist across reboot.

## In Progress

- **US-003** (in-progress): T3b PASS, T3c informational, T3e PASS, T6-128 FAIL (1750 xruns — quantum 256 is Pi 4B hardware floor). **This session:** F-015 diagnosed and fixed, capture-only adapter designed and verified (300s output-only PASS, 120s capture-active PASS on both kernels), RT vs non-RT comparison completed (peak load 35.6% RT vs 63-70% stock). T3d unblocked -- pending Reaper end-to-end. T3a blocked on US-005/US-006. T4 requires physical hardware.
- **Quantum reduction testing** (COMPLETE): Quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL — 1750 xruns. D-011 confirmed: quantum 256 is the minimum viable on Pi 4B. No D-021 needed.
- **F-012** (open, critical): Reaper hard lockup on PREEMPT_RT. Proceeding on stock PREEMPT per D-015. Fix before shipping.
- **F-013** (partially resolved): wayvnc password auth added. TLS required before US-018.
- **F-015** (resolved -- workaround): USB bandwidth contention. Capture-only adapter designed (Phase 9) and verified on both kernels. Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/F-015-playback-stalls.md`.
- **F-016** (open, medium): 2 audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Does not reproduce without restart.
- **F-017** (open, high): Unexplained Pi reboot during Mixxx on RT kernel (~10 min into test). Journal entries lost. Second app (after Reaper) to crash RT kernel -- 0/2 GUI apps stable on RT. D-015 scope extends to Mixxx. Lab note: `docs/lab-notes/F-017-unexplained-reboot.md`.
- **F-018** (resolved): All audio configs now persist across reboot. CamillaDSP SCHED_FIFO 80 via systemd override, PipeWire quantum 256 via static config + systemd user service for force-quantum, RT kernel via config.txt. Verified by capture-verify-worker.
- **D-020** (committed): Web UI architecture -- FastAPI + raw PCM streaming + browser-side FFT. Architecture doc: `docs/architecture/web-ui.md`. A21 (Reaper OSC on ARM) gates Stage 4.
- **US-004** (in-review): Assumption register (A1-A26). Gap: A27 not in register. Pending DoD sign-off.
- **US-000a** (in-review): 4/4 DoD -- F-002 and F-011 both resolved, verified across reboot

### Key Findings from Brain Dump (2026-03-09)
- **CamillaDSP levels API correction:** pycamilladsp `client.levels.levels_since_last()` provides per-channel peak+RMS for both capture and playback (8+8 channels). This informs D-020 metering design.
- **RT kernel strongly validates D-013:** Peak load nearly halved (35.6% vs 63-70%), buffer trends upward (vs draining on stock), 3C cooler, zero throttle events. RT is unambiguously better for DSP -- only F-012/F-017 block production use.
- **Monitoring blind spots:** Researcher identified 14 blind spots in current monitoring. Report pending review.
- **Mixxx ran ~10 min on RT before crash** (F-017). First-time combination. No diagnostic data due to volatile journald.
- **Quantum 128 CATASTROPHIC FAIL:** 1750 xruns at quantum 128. D-011 confirmed -- quantum 256 is the minimum viable setting on Pi 4B. No need for D-021.

- F-012 Reaper RT lockup (requires serial console test rig -- fix before shipping)

- F-016 PipeWire restart glitches (investigate graph clock settling)
- T3d Reaper end-to-end 30-min stability test (unblocked, pending execution)
- Split ALSA device access for USBStreamer capture vs playback (production fix for F-015)
- A21 validation: Reaper OSC on ARM Linux (gates D-020 Stage 4)
- 14-blind-spot monitoring map review (from researcher)
- cloud-init ~3.3s boot overhead (TK-007)

## Blockers

- **F-012: Reaper hard kernel lockup on PREEMPT_RT (CRITICAL).** Reaper causes a reproducible hard kernel lockup on `6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8-rt` within ~1 minute of launch (4 crashes total: 3 on RT incl. `chrt -o 0`, 1 PASS on stock PREEMPT). D-015: continue on stock PREEMPT, fix before shipping. Needs test rig (serial console + scriptable PSU) for kernel oops capture. Blocks: D-013 full compliance, PA-connected production use.
- **F-013: PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** wayvnc password auth added. **TLS required before US-018** deployment (guest musicians' phones on network).
- **F-014: RESOLVED.** RustDesk firewall rules removed (TK-048).
- **F-015: RESOLVED (workaround).** USB bandwidth contention from ada8200-in. Workaround: adapter disabled. **Production fix needed:** split ALSA device access.
- **F-016: OPEN.** Audible glitches after PipeWire restart with capture adapter active. Root cause TBD.
- **F-017: OPEN (high).** Unexplained Pi reboot during Mixxx test on RT kernel. Journal entries lost. Could be same class as F-012 or separate issue. Persistent journald storage needed.
- **F-018: RESOLVED.** All audio configs persist across reboot (CamillaDSP FIFO 80 via systemd override, PipeWire quantum 256 via static config + user service, RT kernel via config.txt). Verified.
